## Sociology of science
###Key concepts

1. Scientific community
1. Received beliefs
1. Normal science


---

## Paradigm shifts

1. First, a new paradigm offers the promise of success
1. Normal science makes good on that promise by
	- filling in details
	- expanding on certain aspects
	- refining theoretical points
	- "mopping up"


---

## Normal science is what most scientists do all their lives!

1. Our image of the scientist may be Einstein, Marie Curie, or Newton making big discoveries
1. Most scientists don't make big discoveries
1. Most scientists don't even *try* to make big discoveries


---

## Normal science as puzzle-solving

1. In normal science, a lot of the time we try to show what we already know
	- if you get a finding that seems too strange, it might not get published
	- scientists are part of a community that "believes" in the dominant paradigm
1. Doing normal science within the dominant paradigm gives the comfort that the problem we are working on actually has a solution
1. We gain success from solving puzzles
1. It is unpopular to say that a puzzle can't be solved
1. Scientists do science because they like solving puzzles


---

## Paradigms

1. Paradigms give coherence to scientific activity
1. Scientists can disagree on all sorts of things, while still remaining within the paradigm
1. Paradigms fill in many of the "elliptical" elements of scientific explanation
1. Paradigms can be cross-disciplinary and have different meanings for different disciplines


---

## Paradigm shift

1. Scientists don't look for anomalies
1. But sometimes they find them
1. After a while, there begin to be so many anomalies, that the dominant paradigm is called into question
1. Paradigm shift brings resistance
1. But notice: without a dominant paradigm *anomalies would not be anomalies!*


---

## Crisis

1. Crises do not usually sneak up on a scientific community 
1. Scientists can respond in many different ways:
	- dig in and resist
	- give up
	- try to keep modifying the dominant paradigm *ad hoc*
	- borrow ideas from a different branch of science
	- etc.


---

## New paradigms

1. Allow researchers to see old problems in new ways
1. Can make old problems irrelevant
1. Raise entirely new questions


---

## The invisibility of paradigms

1. Paradigms are tacit
1. Paradigms are larger than we think
1. The general public in particular may be unaware of scientific paradigms, although they are influenced by them
