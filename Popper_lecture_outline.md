“Those among us who are unwilling to expose their ideas to the hazards of refutation do not take part in the game of science” (Popper, quoted in Dienes, 2008; pg. 12)

Hume’s problem

## Induction 

Hume’s problem

There is *no* amount of evidence that will ever be enough for us to justify believing a theory without a shadow of a doubt.

##Induction

Bertrand Russel father of logical positivism:

If we don’t figure out how induction could  be valid there is
no way to decide between good scientific theory and “the mere obsession of a madman”

---
##Induction

Popper: we don’t need to work out how induction can be valid. 

- Let’s accept that induction can never prove that a theory is right 
- That doesn’t mean we can’t use evidence to prove that a theory is *wrong*

##Popper:

There is only one way to advance human understanding: critical discussion

##Popper:

- Observation without theory is useless
- What would Popper think about data-driven science?

- Color perception

## Criticisms of Popper

---
## Criticisms of Popper

- No theory is falsifiable

---

## Criticisms of Popper

- No theory is falsifiable
- All theories are already falsified anyway

---

## No theory is falsifiable

Accepting an observation statement involves accepting layers of theory supporting the theory being tested

---
## No theory is falsifiable

###Theory: "Music has syntax just like language"

- "Musical syntax is processed in Broca’s area" (Maess et al, 2001)

---
## Background knowledge

- Popper: at a certain level, we just have to accept some information as “background knowledge”
- That doesn’t mean that these theories couldn’t also be tested and falsified
- But it shouldn’t stop us from trying to falsify “our” theories

---

##All theories are falsified anyway

Lakatos: “In the history of science, all theories have been born falsified” (in Dienes, 2008; pg. 22)

---

##All theories are falsified anyway

- Many theories that were widely accepted at the time seem ridiculous today
	- Phrenology
	- Phlogiston

---

##All theories are falsified anyway

- Many theories that are currently accepted are actually countered by evidence
	- Newtonian physics could not explain Mercury’s path in the sky
	- Einstein’s theory of relativity eventually explained Mercury’s behavior, by resorting to explanations outside of Newton’s explanatory framework

---

##Even theories that are wrong, can still be ~~right~~ useful

###Newtonian physics
In one sense, Newtonian physics is “wrong”, because it doesn’t explain everything, but even now we do not reject it entirely. In fact, we
use it all the time.

---

##Even theories that are wrong, can still be ~~right~~ useful

###Linguistic relativity
- In its strong sense has been rejected
- But in a weaker sense, it is very tenacious

---

##Good science (according to Popper) needs:

1. A substantial theory
1. Solid background information
1. A severe test

---

##Using Popper to critique a paper

### Is there a substantial theory?
- A theory from which several predictions follow
- A theory that says both what should happen and what should *not* happen

---

##Using Popper to critique a paper

### Solid background information
- What are the auxiliary assumptions?
- How reliable are they?
- How do we evaluate their reliablity?
- We cannot exhaustively test all of these every time, but we should do as much as possible to identify the auxiliaries decide whether they are safe

---
##Using Popper to critique a paper

### A test that is severe

- A test should make a theory stick its neck out
- A severe test is one in which the predicted outcome is likely given the theory and unlikely given the rest of the background knowledge
- Confounding factors

---

# Popper and politics

- What goes for science also goes for politics
- Political ideas should be criticized and discussed just as
  scientific ideas should be criticized and discussed
- The duty of a scientist is to criticize theories and the duty of a citizen to is criticize leaders

# Popper and our own psychology

How many of our own opinions are based on untested theories built on shaky background information?
