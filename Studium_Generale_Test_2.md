## Pre-test 2

Describe your group’s progress on the Box Project. Remember, the box project assignment is to try to figure out what is in the box, without actually opening it. In your description, please explain:

	1. What methods your group has used so far
	2. Why you have chosen the methods that you have used
	3. The reliability of these methods (keeping in mind Bird’s discussion of reliabilism as a justification for inductive inference)
	4. What hypotheses your group has generated, and the reasons for these hypotheses
	5. The relevance of Popperian falsification for your research on the box
	6. Your personal motivation for conducting research on the box
	7. What your next steps will be in continuing your research on the box
