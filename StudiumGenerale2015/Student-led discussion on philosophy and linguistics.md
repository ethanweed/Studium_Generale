# Linguistics and philosophy

## Group 1

    - Linguistic turn in philosophy
    - If we understand language, we will understand everything else
    - Philosophy and linguistics can complement one another
    - de Saussure: language is structure
        - structure is the essence of language
        - binary approach to meaning: words are defined by everything
          which they are not
    - Chomsky
        - focus on the internal language
        - the surface level is not so important, semantics are not so
          important
        - linguistics is just a part of psychology
        - “poverty of stimulus" argument
        - both de Saussure and Chomsky tried to find a core essence of
          language: structure of language
    - Sociology and physiology are tools that can be used by
      linguistics, but are not themselves linguistics
    - Today, interdisciplinary is in fashion, so it may be an
      old-fashioned question to ask what is or is not “linguistics”.
    - Chomsky may not want to deal with semantics, because he lived at
      a time when “meaning” had been discussed to death - the structure
      of language was more important.
    - Chomsky sought to find the core structure of language
    - Semantics is difficult to formalize, syntax is much more amenable
      to formalization
      
## Group 2

    - Language as a code
    - How to connect words with meaning
        - Reference
            - Words point to things in the world
            - A name points to an actual person in the world
            - But what about function words and other things that
              aren’t proper nouns or concrete nouns?
        - Semiosis
            - Words as symbols which mediate the relationship between
              an object and an idea
            - Why talk about something so simple as referents, when
              there are so many more complex aspects to language than a
              simple word-object relationship
            - Maybe to define central concepts in language - and
              reference is certainly a central concept
            - Why are words an especially good example of the semiotic
              relationship?
                - Perhaps better studied than e.g. images
                
## Group 3
    - Pragmatics
        - Speech-act theory
        - Grice
            - Looking at sentences in context, rather than whether they
              are true or false
        - Neogrammatical approaches to linguistics
            - Words only have meaning in context
            - It is impossible to make a semantic analysis of words, if
              they are not analyzed in context
        - Wittgenstein
            - How do we follow implicit rules?
        - Continental philosophers of language
            - Heidegger
                - Language is a fundamental to our world
                - Language is not in the world but our way of being in
                  the world
                    - Language is not a physical object, so in that
                      way, it doesn’t exist
                    - Nonetheless, the fleeting moments of speech that
                      we produce are an essential aspect of our daily
                      experience/existence
        - Can we actually study words in isolation?
            - Isn’t that what dictionaries do?
            - Yes, it is possible t study words in isolation, but
              perhaps not all words have a “meaning” as such
            - There must be some default meaning for most words, which
              can then be varied or modified by context
            - There are conventions about the way words are used
            - The difficulty that irony can give illustrates that words
              do have a standard meaning. Conversation partners need to
              work hard to change the default meaning of a word
## Group 4

    - Continental philosophers
        - Derrida
            - Language lacks any substantial center
            - We ourselves create the essence of language when we use it
    - Key concepts
        - Chomsky
            - mathematical approach to language
                - systematic rules
        - What is meaning, anyway?
        - Meaning is not just in the head of one person, but is a
          shared entity
        - Reference
            - To what extent do words refer to a single thing, and to
              what degree does it refer to more general concepts?
    - What can philosophy do for linguistics?
        - It can make us uncertain about our object of study
        - Philosophy can be used to help us be critical about our data
          and theories
        - Philosophers can look at linguistics with “fresh” eyes - not
          bound of the same prejudices that we have about the object of
          our study
        - How much do philosophers actually know about linguistics,
          anyway?
