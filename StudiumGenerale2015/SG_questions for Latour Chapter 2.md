# Questions for Latour "Pandora's Hope" Chapter 2

1. Explain in more detail what the connection is that Latour draws
  between the maps the scientists are using and the number on the
  restaurant table where they are spread out 
1. In the first two pictures, Latour describes the confidence of the
  scientists. The want to know more about the forest. In the first
  picture, they are actually in the forest. In the second picture, they
  are in a restaurant, talking about the forest. In the first picture
  Latour describes them as uncertain, in the second they are confident.
  Explain this difference.
1. On page 32 (book numberings, not pdf) Latour discovers that although
  he is deep in the Amazon jungle, he is in a laboratory. Explain.
1. On page 36, Latour talks about the botonist’s filing cabinet, and
  describes it as  being neither near nor far to the forest, but rather
  at a good distance. What does he mean by this?
1. Page 38: “At the card table, with so many trumps in hand, every
  scientist becomes a structuralist.” Explain.
1. Page 48: ‘With its handle, its wooden flame, its padding, and its
  cardboard, the pedocomparator belongs to "things." But in the
  regularity of its cubes, their disposition in columns and rows, their
  discrete character, and the possibility of freely substituting one
  column for another, the pedocomparator belongs to "signs.”’ Can you
  think of a similar example from the world of linguistic research?
1. Page 49: “The earthly dimension of Platonism is revealed in this
  image.” What the heck is Latour talking about?
1. Page 56: Latour compares the forest, the pedocomparator, and a table
  in a scientific article. This movement from forest to table in
  article is captured by his term “inscription”. Give an example of
  linguistic inscription. What are the stages involved?
1. Page 60: “We are always amazed by the minds of scientists, and justly
  so, but we should also admire their utter lack of trust in their own
  cognitive abilities (Hutchins 1995). They doubt their brains so much
  that they need to invent little tricks like this to ensure their
  understanding of the simple color of a soil sample.” How does this
  relate to topics raised by Bird?
1. Later mentions the sentence “The cat is on the mat” several times.
  Why?
1. Explain figures 2.20, 2.21, and 2.22
1. Hume (who we have talked about several times) was an empiricist. The
  Wikipedia entry on empiricism says: *“Empiricism is a theory which
  states that knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory
  experience.[1] One of several views of epistemology, the study of
  human knowledge, along with rationalism and skepticism, empiricism
  emphasizes the role of experience and evidence, especially sensory
  experience, in the formation of ideas, over the notion of innate
  ideas or traditions;[2] empiricists may argue however that traditions
  (or customs) arise due to relations of previous sense experiences.[3]
  Empiricism in the philosophy of science emphasizes evidence,
  especially as discovered in experiments. It is a fundamental part of
  the scientific method that all hypotheses and theories must be tested
  against observations of the natural world rather than resting solely
  on a priori reasoning, intuition, or revelation.
  Empiricism, often used by natural scientists, says that "knowledge is
  based on experience" and that "knowledge is tentative and
  probabilistic, subject to continued revision and falsification."[4]
  One of the epistemological tenets is that sensory experience creates
  knowledge. The scientific method, including experiments and validated
  measurement tools, guides empirical research.”* On page 71, Latour
  says that empiricism is wrong. What is his argument and what is his
  counter-claim? 
1. Page 74: “[…] each stage is matter for what follows and form for what
  precedes it […]”. Explain
1. Page 76: “Constructing a phenomenon in successive layers renders
  it more and more real within a network traced by the displacements
  (in both senses) of researchers, samples, graphics, specimens, maps,
  reports, and funding requests” Can you think of a complimentary
  example from Linguistics?
