# Studium Generale Test 3


Please choose one of the questions below. You may answer in English or Danish. Approximate page counts are given. Normal page lengths are assumed.

Submit your answers by email to ethan@dac.au.dk by Monday 11th at midnight. In the subject line of your email, please write "SG Test 3" and then your name. So for me, I would write "SG Test 3 Ethan Weed". This will help me make sure I don't lose any of your emails.


##Question 1: 
You have decided to apply for funding for a three-year PhD project at Aarhus University. You are free to design the project any way you like, but there are some restrictions. The project must be on one of the following topics: 

-  linguistic relativity
-  linguistic creolization
-  language acquisition
-  linguistics of interactions

Write a draft of your application, including:

- your specific research question
- the methods you will use to research your topic
- a realistic time-line for your project
- your plans for disseminating the results of your research
- any unusual costs or expenses associated with the project

Your application draft should be approximately 5-6 normal pages (not including references), and should be written as realistically as possible. That is, write a project proposal that you feel would have the best possible chances of being funded were it a real proposal and do not propose experiments or other research that would be ethically, financially, or logistically impossible. Treat it as much as possible as if it were a real application, and the progress of your scientific career depended on your project being funded.


##Question 2: 
Pick a recent scientific article from any subfield of linguistics that you are interested in. Read the article and write a critique of the research presented in the article. Integrate the concepts of falsification, inductive reasoning, and “inscription” (in Latour’s sense) in your critique of the article. You do not have to disagree with the conclusions presented by the author(s), but place the article’s research and conclusions in the broader perspective of the history of linguistics, current trends in linguistic research, and insights from the philosophy of science. Your analysis should be approximately 5-6 normal pages (not including references).
