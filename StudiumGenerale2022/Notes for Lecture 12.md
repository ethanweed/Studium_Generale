Compare: Positivists -> Popper -> Kuhn -> Lakatos

**The protective belt**: Even if the Ptolemaic theory is quite wrong, it is no coincidence that it can explain the phenomena because the epicycles have been added in such a way as to ensure that it does.

Example 1 of modifying the protective belt: Tomasello says the most important aspect of **language learning in children** is the social aspect. Naigles says yes, ToM etc. is important, but children also need data to work with. So there is some disagreement about what is most important in terms of language acquisition, but the reason for arguing about these details is to protect the hard core: that children _learn_ language, rather than innately _possessing_ it, as the generativists would say.

Example 2: the **hard core of generativist linguistics** is that language is the abstract ability to generate syntactically correct sentences. There have been lots of iterations and modifications of the rules of transformations, etc., and now the focus is primarily on the role of recursion alone. Again, the reason for all the debate is to protect the hard core.

**"positive heuristic"**: suggestions for what needs to be done to effectively protect the hard core. E.g., if the core is that language is a machine for sentence generation, then we will need to figure out how the machine works, how it applies to different languages, etc. This is a _research program._

If we think that children learn their L1 based on general cognitive abilities, and not language-specific ones, then we need to figure out what those abilities are, and how they apply to language learning: is ToM, is it pattern-finding, etc, and also show how these are different from other animals. This is a different research program.

# Philosophy of science

**Logical Positivism** (Hempel): Look at how well science is proceeding and how much success it has. We just need to keep experimentally testing ideas and we will continue to build our understanding of the world.

**Popper**: We can never be certain we have proved anything, though. All science can do is fail to falsify ideas.

**Kuhn**: Philosophers of science should look at the _history_ of science. Then you will see that science proceeds by long periods of normal, puzzle-solving science, punctuated by occasional paradigm shifts, where everything gets thrown out the window. The only way we can choose the best paradigm is to ask scientists what their opinion is. There is no objective way to know.

**Lakotos**: Maybe we can reconcile Popper and Kuhn. Maybe scientists operate with a hard core of theories that cannot be challenged, and most of their work goes to adjusting the outer "protective" ring of ideas that _can_ be challenged. Thus, we can try to falsify less important details, in the hopes of strengthening the protective ring around the core ideas, which we do not challenge. The building and maintenance of this protective ring provides scientists with a research program.

**Feyerabend**: Science is always a matter of interpretation: it is impossible to uncover pure truths that exist outside of theory. In fact, different theories can explain the same phenomenon equally well, and scientistis who believe one or the other theory are in some sense equally "right", because they exist in different worlds. A modern-day example of Feyerabend's Galileo examples might be fMRI studies. Since Dax and Broca, language has been know to be predominantly localized to the left hemisphere. But fMRI studies have consistently shown right-hemisphere activity that seems to be language-related as well as left-hemisphere activity. So that should mean that we were wrong about the left-lateralization. But just like Galileo's telescope, we don't fully understand the relationship between the BOLD signal and cognition, and one can find examples of BOLD signal as being interpreted both as an indication of cognitive ability in a particular area, but also as evidence for cognitive difficulty in a particular area: either the person is good at the task, so the activity is stronger, or they are bad at it, so they have to work harder, so the activity is stronger. So are we really so sure that fMRI is a better "telescope" than lesion studies?
