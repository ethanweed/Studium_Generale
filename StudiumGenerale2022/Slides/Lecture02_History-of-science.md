## "Science"
<div id = "left">

```

Our present use of the word ‘science’ was first coined in the nineteenth century and, strictly speaking, there was no such thing as ‘science’ in our sense in the early modern period. To talk as though there was, as I have been doing, is an obviously whiggish distortion. Part of our aim, in looking at the historical development of what we think of as science, should be to understand how the very concept ‘science’ arose; we simply beg the question if we talk about ‘science’ as though it always existed.

Henry (2008)

## "Science"

### science (n.)

```
mid-14c., "what is known, knowledge (of something) acquired by study; information;" also "assurance of knowledge, certitude, certainty," from Old French science "knowledge, learning, application; corpus of human knowledge" (12c.), from Latin scientia "knowledge, a knowing; expertness," from sciens(genitive scientis) "intelligent, skilled," present participle of scire "to know," probably originally "to separate one thing from another, to distinguish," related to scindere "to cut, divide" (from PIE root [*skei-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*skei-?ref=etymonline_crossreference "Etymology, meaning and definition of *skei- ") "to cut, split;" source also of Greek skhizein "to split, rend, cleave," Gothic skaidan, Old English sceadan "to divide, separate").

Online Etymology Dictionary (https://www.etymonline.com/word/science)

```

## "Science"

### scientist (n.)

```
1834, a hybrid coined from Latin scientia by the Rev. William Whewell, English polymath, by analogy with *artist*, in the same paragraph in which he coined physicist (q.v.).

<div id = "left">

Oldest known usage of "scientist"

```
1834   W. Whewell in _Q. Rev._   Science..loses all traces of unity. A curious illustration of this result may be observed in the want of any name by which we can designate the students of the knowledge of the material world collectively. We are informed that this difficulty was felt very oppressively by the members of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, at their meetings..in the last three summers... "Philosophers" was felt to be too wide and too lofty a term,..; "savans" was rather assuming,..; some ingenious gentleman proposed that, by analogy with "artist", they might form "scientist" [...]

```
   Science, since people must do it, is a socially embedded activity. It progresses by hunch, vision, and intuition. Much of its change through time does not record a closer approach to absolute truth, but the alteration of cultural contexts that influence it so strongly. Facts are not pure and unsullied bits of information; culture also influences what we see and how we see it. Theories, moreover, are not inexorable inductions from facts. The most creative theories are often imaginative visions imposed upon facts; the source of imagination is also strongly cultural.

- Gould (1981)

 ## Hidden knots in nature (_magia naturalis_)



```
Given the immense variety of nature, the task of the aspiring magus is mind- bogglingly immense – no less than cataloguing the properties of everything. Could there be a shortcut? Some natural philosophers believed that nature contained clues to guide the magus, perhaps as hints implanted there by a merciful God who wants us to understand His creation and benefit from it. The doctrine of signatures claims that some natural objects are ‘signed’ with indications of their hidden qualities. Often, this means that two connected objects look somehow similar, or have some analogous characteristics; for example, the sunflower not only follows the Sun, its blossom actually resembles the Sun in colour and shape. Various parts of plants resemble various parts of the human body; a walnut nestled in its shell looks remarkably like a brain inside the skull. Is this a sign that walnuts would provide good medicines for the brain? The practitioner of magia would have to try these things out to be sure, but observation coupled with the idea of signatures provided a useful point of departure for investigating, explaining, and using the natural world.

### God as a Romance author

</div>

```
the world is like ‘a well contriv’d Romance’. For Boyle, the Creator is the ultimate romance writer, and scientific investigators are the readers trying to figure out all the relationships and crisscrossing storylines in the world He wrote.


```

---

## Good induction, wrong conclusions

```
What our predecessors did was to observe various mysterious and apparently similar phenomena in nature and to extrapolate thence into a more universal statement – a law of nature – about connections and the transmission of influences in the world. This extrapolation led to one tenet that they held that we do not; namely, that similar or analogous objects silently exert influence upon one another. Once that assumption is made, then the rest of the system builds upon it rationally. They were trying to understand the world; they were trying to make sense of things and to make use of the powers of nature.
- Principe (2011)

```

---

## The scientist-priest

```
Robert Boyle, for example, considered his scientific inquiries to be a type of religious devotion (and thus particularly appropriate to do on Sundays) that heightens the natural philosopher’s knowledge and awareness of God through the contemplation of His creation. He described the natural philosopher as a ‘priest of nature’ whose duty it was to expound and interpret the messages written in the Book of Nature, and to gather together and give voice to all creation’s silent praise of its Creator.
- Principe (2011)
