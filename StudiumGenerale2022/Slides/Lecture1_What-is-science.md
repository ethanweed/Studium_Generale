### "Studium Generale"


A place where people can come to study.

---


```
 

The term studium generale, or studium was used to designate universities early on, and referred to the school’s ability to attract students from a broad geographical area, as opposed to a provincial studium particulare, and those studia of the friars.

- Georgedes (2006)

```
---

### "Universitas" -> "University"

- Whole
- Community
- Sum
- Collective

---

### "University"

```
 
the term universitas in the medieval context was the term for a guild or a corporation, and was borrowed from Roman law,16 and, as Leff notes, “had no specific application to a university” in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, but rather “connoted any corporate body or group with an independent juridical status. It could be constituted from three or more persons in a profession who could form their own association (collegium) to protect their rights.”


- Georgedes (2006)

### Theory-construction & data collection


```

About 30 years ago there was much talk that Geologists ought only to observe & not theorise & I well remember some one saying, that at this rate a man might as well go into a gravel-pit & count the pebbles & describe their colours. How odd it is that every one should not see that all observation must be for or against some view, if it is to be of any service.

-Darwin (1861)

```

---

### Theory-construction & data collection

```


If we consider the origin of our knowledge, it is no less certain that … [as] every positive theory must necessarily be founded upon observations, it is, on the other hand, no less true that, in order to observe, our mind has need of some theory or others. If in contemplating phenomena we did not immediately connect them with some principles, not only would it be impossible for us to combine these isolated observations and, therefore, to derive any profit from them, but we should even be entirely incapable of remembering the facts, which would for the most part remain unnoted by us.

-Comte (1858)

```

### Scientific authority


Scienctific authority comes from the confrontation of ideas with empirical data.

Other systems of authority come from texts (e.g. religion, political ideology)



---

### Scientific texts

Peer-reviewed publications

(p-hacking, journal impact factor, reputation, etc.)

---

### Other characteristics of science

- Science is descriptive not prescriptive
- Science is useful
- Science as a social endeavor

---

### Which fields count as science?

- Mathematics?
 - Archaelogy?
- Psychology?
- Linguistics?

## Karl Popper and Demarcation


“Those among us who are unwilling to expose their ideas to the hazards of refutation do not take part in the game of science” (Popper, quoted in Dienes, 2008; pg. 12)

## Induction 

Hume’s problem

## Induction 

Hume’s problem

There is *no* amount of evidence that will ever be enough for us to justify believing a theory without a shadow of a doubt.

- The sun will come up tomorrow

### Induction

Bertrand Russel father of logical positivism:

If we don’t figure out how induction could be valid there is no way to decide between good scientific theory and “the mere obsession of a madman”

---
### Induction

Popper: we don’t need to work out how induction can be valid. 

- Let’s accept that induction can never prove that a theory is right 
- That doesn’t mean we can’t use evidence to prove that a theory is *wrong*

---
### Popper:

There is only one way to advance human understanding: _critical discussion_

---
### Popper:

- Observation without theory is useless
- What would Popper think about data-driven science, e.g. "data science"?

---
### Demarcation
- Science vs pseudoscience

---
### Demarcation
- Science vs pseudoscience
- Marxism
- Freudian psychology
- Chomskyian linguistics?
- Functionalist linguistics?
- Linguistic relativity?

## Criticisms of Popper

---
## Criticisms of Popper

- No theory is falsifiable

---

## Criticisms of Popper

- No theory is falsifiable
- All theories are already falsified anyway

---

## No theory is falsifiable

Accepting an observation statement involves accepting layers of theory supporting the theory being tested

---
## No theory is falsifiable

###Theory: "Music has syntax just like language"

- "Musical syntax is processed in Broca’s area" (Maess et al, 2001)
- http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v4/n5/full/nn0501_540.html

---
## Background knowledge

- Popper: at a certain level, we just have to accept some information as “background knowledge”
- That doesn’t mean that these theories couldn’t also be tested and falsified
- But it shouldn’t stop us from trying to falsify “our” theories

---

##All theories are falsified anyway

Lakatos: “In the history of science, all theories have been born falsified” (in Dienes, 2008; pg. 22)

---

##All theories are falsified anyway

- Many theories that were widely accepted at the time seem ridiculous today
	- Phrenology
	- Phlogiston

---

##All theories are falsified anyway

- Many theories that are currently accepted are actually countered by evidence
	- Newtonian physics could not explain Mercury’s path in the sky
	- Einstein’s theory of relativity eventually explained Mercury’s behavior, by resorting to explanations outside of Newton’s explanatory framework

---

##Even theories that are wrong, can still be ~~right~~ useful

###Newtonian physics
In one sense, Newtonian physics is “wrong”, because it doesn’t explain everything, but even now we do not reject it entirely. In fact, we
use it all the time.

---

##Even theories that are wrong, can still be ~~right~~ useful

###Linguistic relativity
- In its strong sense has been rejected
- But in a weaker sense, it is very tenacious

---

##Good science (according to Popper) needs:

1. A substantial theory
1. Solid background information
1. A severe test

---

##Using Popper to critique a paper

### Is there a substantial theory?
- A theory from which several predictions follow
- A theory that says both what should happen and what should *not* happen

---

##Using Popper to critique a paper

### Solid background information
- What are the auxiliary assumptions?
- How reliable are they?
- How do we evaluate their reliablity?
- We cannot exhaustively test all of these every time, but we should do as much as possible to identify the auxiliaries decide whether they are safe

---
##Using Popper to critique a paper

### A test that is severe

- A test should make a theory stick its neck out
- A severe test is one in which the predicted outcome is likely given the theory and unlikely given the rest of the background knowledge
- Confounding factors

---

# Popper and politics

- What goes for science also goes for politics
- Political ideas should be criticized and discussed just as
  scientific ideas should be criticized and discussed
- The duty of a scientist is to criticize theories and the duty of a citizen to is criticize leaders

---

# Popper and our own psychology

How many of our own opinions are based on untested theories built on shaky background information?

times too the scientific revolution did not come from nowhere. In
these earlier periods the dominant world-view was Aristotelianism,
named after the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, who put
forward detailed theories in physics, biology, astronomy, and
cosmology. But Aristotle's ideas would seem very strange to a
modern scientist, as would his methods of enquiry. To pick just one
example, he believed that all earthly bodies are composed of just
four elements: earth, fire, air, and water. This view is obviously at
odds with what modern chemistry tells us.

Taken together, Kepler's laws provided a far superior planetary
theory than had ever been advanced before, solving problems that
had confounded astronomers for centuries. Galileo was a life-long
supporter of Copernicanism, and one of the early pioneers of the
telescope. When he pointed his telescope at the heavens, he made a
wealth of amazing discoveries, including mountains on the moon, a
vast array of stars, sun-spots, and Jupiter's moons. All of these
conflicted thoroughly with Aristotelian cosmology, and played a
pivotal role in converting the scientific community to
Copernicanism.

species to evolve into a wholly new one, Darwin argued. So
persuasive was the evidence Darwin adduced for his theory that by
the start of the 20th century it was accepted as scientific
orthodoxy, despite considerable theological opposition (Figure 3).
Subsequent work has provided striking confirmation of Darwin's
theory, which forms the centrepiece of the modern biological
world-view.

consider scientific experimentation. Suppose a scientist does an
experiment and gets a particular result. He repeats the experiment
a few times and keeps getting the same result. After that he will
probably stop, confident that were he to keep repeating the
experiment, under exactly the same conditions, he would continue
to get the same result. This assumption may seem obvious, but as
philosophers we want to question it. Why assume that future
repetitions of the experiment will yield the same result? How do we
know this is true? The scientist is unlikely to spend too much time
puzzling over these somewhat curious questions: he probably has
better things to do. They are quintessentially philosophical
questions, to which we return in the next chapter.

The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein argued that there is no
fixed set of features that define what it is to be a 'game'. Rather,
there is a loose cluster of features most of which are possessed by
most games. But any particular game may lack any of the features in
the cluster and still be a game. The same may be true of science. If
so, a simple criterion for demarcating science from pseudo-science
is unlikely to be found.
