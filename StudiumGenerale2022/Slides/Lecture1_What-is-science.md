# Studium General


---

## "Studium Generale"


```
 

The term studium generale, or studium was used to designate universities early on, and referred to the school’s ability to attract students from a broad geographical area, as opposed to a provincial studium particulare, and those studia of the friars.

- Georgedes (2006)

```

---

## "Universitas"

- Whole
- Community
- Sum   
- Collective

---

## "University"

```
 
the term universitas in the medieval context was the term for a guild or a corporation, and was borrowed from Roman law,16 and, as Leff notes, “had no specific application to a university” in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, but rather “connoted any corporate body or group with an independent juridical status. It could be constituted from three or more persons in a profession who could form their own association (collegium) to protect their rights.


- Georgedes (2006)

## What is science?




<div id="left_border">

The attempt to understand, explain, and predict the world.

</div>
<div id="right_border">

Compare with: 

- Religion
- Mythology
- Astrology
- Divination
- History

## Is science defined by its methods?

- Experimentation
- Hypothesis-testing
- Theory-construction
- Data collection

---

## Experimentation & data collection

- Historians collect data
- Historians develop theories
- They can't really do experiments


---

## Theory-construction & data collection


```

About 30 years ago there was much talk that Geologists ought only to observe & not theorise & I well remember some one saying, that at this rate a man might as well go into a gravel-pit & count the pebbles & describe their colours. How odd it is that every one should not see that all observation must be for or against some view, if it is to be of any service.

-Darwin (1861)

```

---

## Theory-construction & data collection

```


If we consider the origin of our knowledge, it is no less certain that … [as] every positive theory must necessarily be founded upon observations, it is, on the other hand, no less true that, in order to observe, our mind has need of some theory or others. If in contemplating phenomena we did not immediately connect them with some principles, not only would it be impossible for us to combine these isolated observations and, therefore, to derive any profit from them, but we should even be entirely incapable of remembering the facts, which would for the most part remain unnoted by us.

-Comte (1858)

```


---

## Scientific authority


- Scienctific authority comes from the confrontation of ideas with empirical data.

- Other systems of authority come from texts (e.g. religion, political ideology)



---

## Scientific texts

- Peer-reviewed publications

- (p-hacking, journal impact factor, reputation, etc.)

---

## Other characteristics of science

- Science is descriptive not prescriptive
- Science is useful
- Science as a social endeavor

---

## Which fields count as science?

# Science as induction

---

## What is induction?

**Deduction**: If the premises are correct, the conclusion is _certain_  

**Induction**: If the premises are correct, the conclusion in _probable_

<div id="right">

There is *no* amount of evidence that will ever be enough for us to justify believing a theory without a shadow of a doubt.

<div id="right">
If we don’t figure out how induction could be valid there is no way to decide between good scientific theory and “the mere obsession of a madman”

<div id="left">

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Karl_Popper.jpg" width = "350"/>

</div>

<div id="left">

We don’t need to work out how induction can be valid. Just because induction can never prove a theory right, doesn't mean that we can't use it to prove a theory *wrong*.

## Popper

</div>

<div id="right">

There is only one way to advance human understanding: _critical discussion_

```

The realization that natural science is not indubitable epistēmē (scientia) has led to the view that it is technē(technique, art, technology); but the proper view, I believe, is that it consists of doxai (opinions, conjectures),controlled by critical discussion as well as by experimental technē

- Popper (1962) pg. 102

The most characteristic element in this situation seemed to me the incessant stream of confirmations, of observations which "verified" the theories in question; and this point was constantly emphasize by their adherents. A Marxist could not open a newspaper without finding on every page confirming evidence for his interpretation of history; not only in the news, but also in its presentation — which revealed the class bias of the paper — and especially of course what the paper did not say. The Freudian analysts emphasized that their theories were constantly verified by their "clinical observations." As for Adler, I was much impressed by a personal experience. Once, in 1919, I reported to him a case which to me did not seem particularly Adlerian, but which he found no difficulty in analyzing in terms of his theory of inferiority feelings, Although he had not even seen the child. Slightly shocked, I asked him how he could be so sure. "Because of my thousandfold experience," he replied; whereupon I could not help saying: "And with this new case, I suppose, your experience has become thousand-and-one-fold." 

 

What I had in mind was that his previous observations may not have been much  sounder than this new one; that each in its turn had been interpreted in the light of "previous experience," and at the same time counted as additional confirmation. What, I asked myself, did it confirm? No more than that a case could be interpreted in the light of a theory. But this meant very little, I reflected, since every conceivable case could be interpreted in the light Adler's theory, or equally of Freud's.

## Good science (according to Popper) needs:

::: incremental

1. A substantial theory
1. Solid background information
1. A severe test

:::


---

## Using Popper to critique a paper

Is there a substantial theory?

- A theory from which several predictions follow
- A theory that says both what should happen and what should *not* happen

---

## Using Popper to critique a paper

Solid background information

<div id = "left_border">

- What are the auxiliary assumptions?
- How do we evaluate their reliablity?

</div>

<div id = "right_border">

- We cannot exhaustively test all of these every time, but we should do as much as possible to identify the auxiliaries to decide whether they are safe


</div>






---

## Using Popper to critique a paper

A test that is severe

- A test should make a theory stick its neck out
- A severe test is one in which the predicted outcome is likely given the theory and unlikely given the rest of the background knowledge
- Confounding factors

---

## Popper and politics

<div id="left_border">
- What goes for science also goes for politics
- Political ideas should be criticized and discussed just as
  scientific ideas should be criticized and discussed

  <div id="right_border">
- The duty of a scientist is to criticize theories and the duty of a citizen to is criticize leaders

## Dawson and Stapel: 

Telling us what we want to hear.

```

 

“I didn’t do strange stuff, I never said let’s do an experiment to show that the earth is flat,” he said. “I always checked — this may be by a cunning manipulative mind — that the experiment was reasonable, that it followed from the research that had come before, that it was just this extra step that everybody was waiting for.” He always read the research literature extensively to generate his hypotheses. “So that it was believable and could be argued that this was the only logical thing you would find,” he said. “Everybody wants you to be novel and creative, but you also need to be truthful and likely. You need to be able to say that this is completely new and exciting, but it’s very likely given what we know so far.”

-Stapel, quoted in Bhattacharjee (2013)

## Questionable Research Practices

<div id = "left">

- p-hacking
- HARKing
- Cherry-picking
- Fishing Expeditions

</div>

<div id = "right">

```
Questionable research practices (QRPs) in the statistical analysis of data and in the presentation of the results in research papers include HARKing, cherry-picking, P-hacking, fishing, and data dredging or mining. HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known) is the presentation of a post hoc hypothesis as an a priori hypothesis. Cherry-picking is the presentation of favorable evidence with the concealment of unfavorable evidence. P-hacking is the relentless analysis of data with an intent to obtain a statistically significant result, usually to support the researcher's hypothesis. A fishing expedition is the indiscriminate testing of associations between different combinations of variables not with specific hypotheses in mind but with the hope of finding something that is statistically significant in the data. Data dredging and data mining describe the extensive testing of relationships between a large number of variables for which data are available, usually in a database.
