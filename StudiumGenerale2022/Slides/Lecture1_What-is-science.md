## "Studium Generale"


```
 

The term studium generale, or studium was used to designate universities early on, and referred to the school’s ability to attract students from a broad geographical area, as opposed to a provincial studium particulare, and those studia of the friars.

- Georgedes (2006)

```

---

## "Universitas"

- Whole
- Community
- Sum   
- Collective

---

## "University"

```
 
the term universitas in the medieval context was the term for a guild or a corporation, and was borrowed from Roman law,16 and, as Leff notes, “had no specific application to a university” in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, but rather “connoted any corporate body or group with an independent juridical status. It could be constituted from three or more persons in a profession who could form their own association (collegium) to protect their rights.”


- Georgedes (2006)

# What is science?

## What is science?




<div id="left_border">

The attempt to understand, explain, and predict the world.

</div>
<div id="right_border">

Compare with: 

- Religion
- Mythology

## Is science defined by its methods?

- Experimentation
- Hypothesis-testing
- Theory-construction
- Data collection

---

## Experimentation & data collection

- Historians collect data
- Historians develop theories
- They can't really do experiments


---

## Theory-construction & data collection


```

About 30 years ago there was much talk that Geologists ought only to observe & not theorise & I well remember some one saying, that at this rate a man might as well go into a gravel-pit & count the pebbles & describe their colours. How odd it is that every one should not see that all observation must be for or against some view, if it is to be of any service.

-Darwin (1861)

```

---

## Theory-construction & data collection

```


If we consider the origin of our knowledge, it is no less certain that … [as] every positive theory must necessarily be founded upon observations, it is, on the other hand, no less true that, in order to observe, our mind has need of some theory or others. If in contemplating phenomena we did not immediately connect them with some principles, not only would it be impossible for us to combine these isolated observations and, therefore, to derive any profit from them, but we should even be entirely incapable of remembering the facts, which would for the most part remain unnoted by us.

-Comte (1858)

```

## Scientific authority


Scienctific authority comes from the confrontation of ideas with empirical data.

Other systems of authority come from texts (e.g. religion, political ideology)



---

## Scientific texts

Peer-reviewed publications

(p-hacking, journal impact factor, reputation, etc.)

---

## Other characteristics of science

- Science is descriptive not prescriptive
- Science is useful
- Science as a social endeavor

---

## Which fields count as science?

- Mathematics?
 - Archaelogy?
- Psychology?
- Linguistics?

---

# Science as induction

**Deduction**: If the premises are correct, the conclusion is _certain_  

**Induction**: If the premises are correct, the conclusion in _probable_

## Induction: Hume’s problem

David Hume (1711-1776)

</div>

<div id="right">

There is *no* amount of evidence that will ever be enough for us to justify believing a theory without a shadow of a doubt.

</div>

## Induction

Bertrand Russell (1872-1970)

</div>
<div id="right">
If we don’t figure out how induction could be valid there is no way to decide between good scientific theory and “the mere obsession of a madman”

</div>

## Induction

Karl Popper (1902-1994)

<div id="left">

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Karl_Popper.jpg" width = "350"/>

</div>

<div id="left">

We don’t need to work out how induction can be valid. Just because induction can never prove a theory right, doesn't mean that we can't use it to prove a theory *wrong*.

</div>

## Popper

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Karl_Popper.jpg" width = "350"/>

</div>

<div id="right">

There is only one way to advance human understanding: _critical discussion_

```

The realization that natural science is not indubitable epistēmē (scientia) has led to the view that it is technē(technique, art, technology); but the proper view, I believe, is that it consists of doxai (opinions, conjectures),controlled by critical discussion as well as by experimental technē

- Popper (1962) pg. 102

Those among us who are unwilling to expose their ideas to the hazards of refutation do not take part in the game of science

## Demarcation

<div id="left_border">
Science vs pseudoscience
</div>

<div id="right_border">
- Marxism?
- Freudian psychology?
- Linguistic relativity?

## Criticisms of Popper

<div id="right_border">
- No theory is falsifiable
- All theories are already falsified anyway
</div>

---

## No theory is falsifiable
<div id="left_border">
Accepting any observation statement involves accepting layers of theory supporting the theory being tested
</div>

---

## Background knowledge


<div id="left_border">

- Popper: at a certain level, we just have to accept some theories as “background knowledge”
- These theories could also be tested and falsified

</div>

<div id="right_border">

- But this shouldn’t stop us from trying to falsify “our” theories

</div>

## All theories are falsified anyway

## Even things we do "believe" are "wrong"

Newtonian physics cannot entirely explain Mercury's orbit

## Not right, but also... not wrong

<div id = "left">
:::incremental
*Newtonian physics*

- Cannot fully explain physical phenomena
- But is good enough most of the time
- Relativity helps fill in the details
- And quantum physics fills in even more

## Good science (according to Popper) needs:

::: incremental

1. A substantial theory
1. Solid background information
1. A severe test
