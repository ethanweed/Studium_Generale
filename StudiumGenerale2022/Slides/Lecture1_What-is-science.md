### "Studium Generale"


A place where people can come to study.

---


```
 

The term studium generale, or studium was used to designate universities early on, and referred to the school’s ability to attract students from a broad geographical area, as opposed to a provincial studium particulare, and those studia of the friars.

- Georgedes (2006)

### "Universitas" -> "University"

### "University"

```
 
the term universitas in the medieval context was the term for a guild or a corporation, and was borrowed from Roman law,16 and, as Leff notes, “had no specific application to a university” in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, but rather “connoted any corporate body or group with an independent juridical status. It could be constituted from three or more persons in a profession who could form their own association (collegium) to protect their rights.”

### Goals

   

- Provide an introduction to scientific reasoning, praxis, and culture
- Discuss the relationship of humanities and science
- Outline some of the major ideas in the philosophy of science
- Position linguistics within the architecture of scientific thought and culture, including nearby disciplines such as anthropology, archaeology, psychology, sociology, and cognitive science
- Give you a basis in significant writings by linguists of the twentieth century (mainly)

### Theory-construction & data collection


```

About 30 years ago there was much talk that Geologists ought only to observe & not theorise & I well remember some one saying, that at this rate a man might as well go into a gravel-pit & count the pebbles & describe their colours. How odd it is that every one should not see that all observation must be for or against some view, if it is to be of any service.

-Darwin (1861)

### Theory-construction & data collection

```


If we consider the origin of our knowledge, it is no less certain that … [as] every positive theory must necessarily be founded upon observations, it is, on the other hand, no less true that, in order to observe, our mind has need of some theory or others. If in contemplating phenomena we did not immediately connect them with some principles, not only would it be impossible for us to combine these isolated observations and, therefore, to derive any profit from them, but we should even be entirely incapable of remembering the facts, which would for the most part remain unnoted by us.

-Comte (1858)

Surely science is just the attempt to understand, explain, and
predict the world we live in? This is certainly a reasonable answer.
But is it the whole story? After all, the various religions also attempt
to understand and explain the world, but religion is not usually
regarded as a branch of science. Similarly, astrology and fortune
telling are attempts to predict the future, but most people would not
describe these activities as science. Or consider history. Historians
try to understand and explain what happened in the past, but
history is usually classified as an arts subject not a science subject.
As with many philosophical questions, the question 'what is
science?' turns out to be trickier than it looks at first sight.

times too the scientific revolution did not come from nowhere. In
these earlier periods the dominant world-view was Aristotelianism,
named after the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, who put
forward detailed theories in physics, biology, astronomy, and
cosmology. But Aristotle's ideas would seem very strange to a
modern scientist, as would his methods of enquiry. To pick just one
example, he believed that all earthly bodies are composed of just
four elements: earth, fire, air, and water. This view is obviously at
odds with what modern chemistry tells us.

Taken together, Kepler's laws provided a far superior planetary
theory than had ever been advanced before, solving problems that
had confounded astronomers for centuries. Galileo was a life-long
supporter of Copernicanism, and one of the early pioneers of the
telescope. When he pointed his telescope at the heavens, he made a
wealth of amazing discoveries, including mountains on the moon, a
vast array of stars, sun-spots, and Jupiter's moons. All of these
conflicted thoroughly with Aristotelian cosmology, and played a
pivotal role in converting the scientific community to
Copernicanism.

species to evolve into a wholly new one, Darwin argued. So
persuasive was the evidence Darwin adduced for his theory that by
the start of the 20th century it was accepted as scientific
orthodoxy, despite considerable theological opposition (Figure 3).
Subsequent work has provided striking confirmation of Darwin's
theory, which forms the centrepiece of the modern biological
world-view.

consider scientific experimentation. Suppose a scientist does an
experiment and gets a particular result. He repeats the experiment
a few times and keeps getting the same result. After that he will
probably stop, confident that were he to keep repeating the
experiment, under exactly the same conditions, he would continue
to get the same result. This assumption may seem obvious, but as
philosophers we want to question it. Why assume that future
repetitions of the experiment will yield the same result? How do we
know this is true? The scientist is unlikely to spend too much time
puzzling over these somewhat curious questions: he probably has
better things to do. They are quintessentially philosophical
questions, to which we return in the next chapter.

The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein argued that there is no
fixed set of features that define what it is to be a 'game'. Rather,
there is a loose cluster of features most of which are possessed by
most games. But any particular game may lack any of the features in
the cluster and still be a game. The same may be true of science. If
so, a simple criterion for demarcating science from pseudo-science
is unlikely to be found.
