## "Studium Generale"


```
 

The term studium generale, or studium was used to designate universities early on, and referred to the school’s ability to attract students from a broad geographical area, as opposed to a provincial studium particulare, and those studia of the friars.

## "University"

```
 
the term universitas in the medieval context was the term for a guild or a corporation, and was borrowed from Roman law,16 and, as Leff notes, “had no specific application to a university” in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, but rather “connoted any corporate body or group with an independent juridical status. It could be constituted from three or more persons in a profession who could form their own association (collegium) to protect their rights.”
