### "Studium Generale"


A place where people can come to study.

---


```
 

The term studium generale, or studium was used to designate universities early on, and referred to the school’s ability to attract students from a broad geographical area, as opposed to a provincial studium particulare, and those studia of the friars.

- Georgedes (2006)

```
---

### "Universitas" -> "University"

- Whole
- Community
- Sum
- Collective

---

### "University"

```
 
the term universitas in the medieval context was the term for a guild or a corporation, and was borrowed from Roman law,16 and, as Leff notes, “had no specific application to a university” in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, but rather “connoted any corporate body or group with an independent juridical status. It could be constituted from three or more persons in a profession who could form their own association (collegium) to protect their rights.”


- Georgedes (2006)

### This course


```   

Designed to give an introduction to scientific and humanistic reasoning, praxis, and culture that is oriented to the concerns of linguistics as a discipline.

```


---

### Goals

   

- Provide an introduction to scientific reasoning, praxis, and culture
- Discuss the relationship of humanities and science
- Outline some of the major ideas in the philosophy of science
- Position linguistics within the architecture of scientific thought and culture, including nearby disciplines such as anthropology, archaeology, psychology, sociology, and cognitive science
- Give you a basis in significant writings by linguists of the twentieth century (mainly)

---

### What is science?

Talk amongst yourselves


---

The attempt to understand, explain, and predict the world.

---

### Experimentation & data collection



---

### Theory-construction & data collection


```

About 30 years ago there was much talk that Geologists ought only to observe & not theorise & I well remember some one saying, that at this rate a man might as well go into a gravel-pit & count the pebbles & describe their colours. How odd it is that every one should not see that all observation must be for or against some view, if it is to be of any service.

-Darwin (1861)

```

---

### Theory-construction & data collection

```


If we consider the origin of our knowledge, it is no less certain that … [as] every positive theory must necessarily be founded upon observations, it is, on the other hand, no less true that, in order to observe, our mind has need of some theory or others. If in contemplating phenomena we did not immediately connect them with some principles, not only would it be impossible for us to combine these isolated observations and, therefore, to derive any profit from them, but we should even be entirely incapable of remembering the facts, which would for the most part remain unnoted by us.

-Comte (1858)

```


---

### Scientific authority


Scienctific authority comes from the confrontation of ideas with empirical data.

Other systems of authority come from texts (e.g. religion, political ideology)



---

### Scientific texts

Peer-reviewed publications

(p-hacking, journal impact factor, reputation, etc.)

---

### Other characteristics of science

- Science is descriptive not prescriptive
- Science is useful
- Science as a social endeavor

---

### Which fields count as science?

- Mathematics?
 - Archaelogy?
- Psychology?
- Linguistics?

---

## Karl Popper and Demarcation


“Those among us who are unwilling to expose their ideas to the hazards of refutation do not take part in the game of science” (Popper, quoted in Dienes, 2008; pg. 12)

### Induction: Hume’s problem

### Induction: Hume’s problem


There is *no* amount of evidence that will ever be enough for us to justify believing a theory without a shadow of a doubt.

- The sun will come up tomorrow

### Induction: Hume’s problem

Hume’s problem

There is *no* amount of evidence that will ever be enough for us to justify believing a theory without a shadow of a doubt.

- The sun will come up tomorrow
- I will get up tomorrow

### Induction

Bertrand Russel father of logical positivism:

If we don’t figure out how induction could be valid there is no way to decide between good scientific theory and “the mere obsession of a madman”

---
### Induction

Popper: we don’t need to work out how induction can be valid. 

- Let’s accept that induction can never prove that a theory is right 
- That doesn’t mean we can’t use evidence to prove that a theory is *wrong*

---
### Popper:

There is only one way to advance human understanding: _critical discussion_

---

### Demarcation
- Science vs pseudoscience

---

### Demarcation
- Science vs pseudoscience
- Marxism?
- Freudian psychology?
- Linguistic relativity?

---

## Criticisms of Popper

---
## Criticisms of Popper

- No theory is falsifiable

---

## Criticisms of Popper

- No theory is falsifiable
- All theories are already falsified anyway

---

## No theory is falsifiable

Accepting an observation statement involves accepting layers of theory supporting the theory being tested

---
## No theory is falsifiable

### Theory: "Music has syntax just like language"

- "Musical syntax is processed in Broca’s area" (Maess et al, 2001)
- http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v4/n5/full/nn0501_540.html

---
## Background knowledge

- Popper: at a certain level, we just have to accept some information as “background knowledge”
- That doesn’t mean that these theories couldn’t also be tested and falsified
- But it shouldn’t stop us from trying to falsify “our” theories

---

### All theories are falsified anyway

Lakatos: “In the history of science, all theories have been born falsified” (in Dienes, 2008; pg. 22)

---

### All theories are falsified anyway

- Many theories that were widely accepted at the time seem ridiculous today
	- Phrenology
	- Phlogiston

---

### All theories are falsified anyway

- Many theories that are currently accepted are actually countered by evidence
	- Newtonian physics could not explain Mercury’s path in the sky
	- Einstein’s theory of relativity eventually explained Mercury’s behavior, by resorting to explanations outside of Newton’s explanatory framework

---

### Even theories that are wrong, can still be ~~right~~ useful

#### Newtonian physics
In one sense, Newtonian physics is “wrong”, because it doesn’t explain everything, but even now we do not reject it entirely. In fact, we
use it all the time.

---

### Even theories that are wrong, can still be ~~right~~ useful

#### Linguistic relativity
- In its strong sense has been rejected
- But in a weaker sense, it is very tenacious

---

### Good science (according to Popper) needs:

1. A substantial theory
1. Solid background information
1. A severe test

---

### Using Popper to critique a paper

### Is there a substantial theory?
- A theory from which several predictions follow
- A theory that says both what should happen and what should *not* happen

---

### Using Popper to critique a paper

### Solid background information
- What are the auxiliary assumptions?
- How reliable are they?
- How do we evaluate their reliablity?
- We cannot exhaustively test all of these every time, but we should do as much as possible to identify the auxiliaries decide whether they are safe

---
### Using Popper to critique a paper

### A test that is severe

- A test should make a theory stick its neck out
- A severe test is one in which the predicted outcome is likely given the theory and unlikely given the rest of the background knowledge
- Confounding factors

---

### Popper and politics

- What goes for science also goes for politics
- Political ideas should be criticized and discussed just as
  scientific ideas should be criticized and discussed
- The duty of a scientist is to criticize theories and the duty of a citizen to is criticize leaders

---

### Popper and our own psychology

How many of our own opinions are based on untested theories built on shaky background information?
