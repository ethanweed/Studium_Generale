<em>Formalism</em>

Syntax is autonomous, and can be studied in isolation


</div>



<div id = "right">
<em>Functionalism</em>

Syntax interacts with other components of grammar (and cognition)

Language arose in biological evolution and grammar is genetically coded

</div>

<em>Formalism</em>

Grammatical rules exist that change structures, giving rise to distinct levels of surface vs. deep structure

</div>



<div id = "right">
<em>Functionalism</em>

   

Structures do not change by grammatical rules. No contrast between deep and surface structures: there is only language.

<em>Formalism</em>

   

No significant theoretical place for constructions – it is the grammatical rules that are central

</div>



<div id = "right">
<em>Functionalism</em>

      

Syntactic structures (constructions) play a central role


</div>

<em>Formalism</em>

   

Iconicity of grammatical structures is largely an illusion

</div>



<div id = "right">
<em>Functionalism</em>


Grammatical structures are often iconic

</div>

<em>Formalism</em>

   

An important feature of a good grammar is that it is generative

</div>



<div id = "right">
<em>Functionalism</em>

Generativity of a grammar is not always considered important
