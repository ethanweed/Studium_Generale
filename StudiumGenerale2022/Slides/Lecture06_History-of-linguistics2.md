What do you remember about:

# Colonial Linguistics

## Colonial era 

<div id = "left">

	- Americas
	- Africa
	- Asia 
	- Oceania

## Colonial Linguistics

- Mostly amateurs
- Often missionaries
- Used Latin grammar to describe other languages

### A professional in the colonies

<div id = "left">

Wilhelm Heinrich Immanuel Bleek (1827-1875)

## A "failed" expedition

<div id = "left">

In 1791, Captain Arthur Phillip (govenor of New South Wales) set out to "_to reach Hawkesbury-River, opposite Richmond Hill, and, if possible, to cross the river and get to the mountains_" and to "_ascertain whether or not the Hawkesbury and the Nepean, were the same river_"

</div>

The expedition sets out on April 11, and consists of 21 people including:

<div id = "left">

- Gulbi (Colbee, Colebe)
- Baludiri (Boladeree, Ballederry)
- Governor Phillip
- Captain Collins (judge-advocate) and his servant
- Captain Tench

</div>

<div id = "right">

- Lieutenant Dawes
- Mr White (principal surgeon)
- two sergeants
- eight privates
- three gamekeepers (i.e. ‘three convicts who were good marksmen’)

</div>

The expedition achieves none of its goals.

---

But they did make some important linguistic discoveries.

---

Tench:

```
But one variety struck us more forcibly. Although our natives and the strangers conversed on a par, and understood each other perfectly, yet they spoke different dialects of the same language; many of the most common and necessary words, used in life, bearing no similitude, and others being slightly different.
```


---

Collins:

```
We often heard, that people from the northward had been met with, who could not be exactly understood by our friends; but this is not so wonderful as that people living at the distance of only fifty or sixty miles should call the sun and moon by different names; such, however, was the fact. In an excursion to the banks of the Hawkesbury, accompanied by two Sydney natives, we first discovered this difference; but our companions conversed with the river natives without any apparent difficulty, each understanding or comprehending the other.
```

---

Phillip:

```
[...] there is good reason to believe several different languages are spoken by the natives of this country, and this accounts for only one or two of those words given in Captain Cook’s vocabulary having ever been heard amongst the natives who visited the settlement.
```

### Comparative Linguistics

---

### Discoveries of the Phillip expedition

1. That the language of the Burubirangal appears to have been a sister dialect of that spoken by the Iyura, and that one dialect marker is the correspondence of _nd_ in Burubirangal words with simple _n_ in Iyura words


---

### Discoveries of the Phillip expedition

2. That the language spoken by the people encountered on the Hawkesbury, is distinct from that on the coast (and that spoken by the Burubirangal) and appears to be the same language, or a dialect of the same language, as Darkinyung.

---

### Discoveries of the Phillip expedition


3. That Gulbi and Baludiri could converse with the different people encountered is also the first clear indication of the multilingual and multidialectal capabilities that was typical of the Aboriginal inhabitants. We have here the first recording of what appears to be a bilingual conversation with each party using their own language.

---

### A "failed" expedition


```
With hindsight, the real failure of this expedition is that its participants, and other observers, were blind to its successes. A rich spectrum of ethnographic and linguistic discoveries was relegated to the realm of insignificance when Collins pronounced that the expedition returned ‘without making any discovery of the least importance.’ One can only speculate as to whether history would have been any different if such discoveries had been vested with real significance and worth. -Wilkins and Nash (2008)

# Modern linguistics

## Ferdinand de Saussure (1857-1913)

- Swiss Professor of Sanskrit
- Father of modern linguistics

</div>


---

## Ferdinand de Saussure 

```
In a language there are only differences without positive terms. Whether we take the signified or the signifier, the language contains neither ideas nor sounds that pre-exist the linguistic system, but only conceptual differences and phonic differences issuing from this system
```

## Rise of the phoneme

<div id = "left">

- Henry Sweet (1845-1912) 
- Baudouin de Courtenay (1845-1929) 
- Dufriche-Desgenettes (1804-1878)

</div>

<div id = "right">


Phonological debates:
	- phones vs. phonemes
	- intention vs. execution
	- influence of orthography
	- psychological reality


</div>

## Diversification of linguistics in C20


---

### The Prague school

<div id = "left">

- Nicholai Trubetzkoy (1890-1938)
- Placed the notion of the phoneme in the centre of linguistic theory

</div>

<div id = "right">

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Nikolai_Trubetzkoy.jpg" width=""/>

</div>

---

### The Prague school

<div id = "left">

- Roman Jakobson (1896-1982) 
- phonology
- syntax, morphology, semantics
- film, poetry, music criticism
</div>

<div id = "right">

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Roman_Yakobson.jpg" width=""/>

### Jakobson's model of communication

### British structuralism

J.R. Firth(1890-1960)

<div id = "left">

-  Influenced by Bronislaw Malinowski
- Developed a contextual theory of meaning
- Meaning is use _in context_
</div>

<div id = "right">

</div>

---

### British structuralism

J.R. Firth 

<div id = "left">

Polysystemicity of languages:  

- A language is not one system, but many systems
- E.g. different consonantal phonologies for word initial, medial, and/or final position
- Different case systems for nouns and pronouns

</div>

</div>

---

### British ~~structuralism~~ functionalism

<div id = "left">
- Michael Halliday (1925-2018)
- Firth's student  
- Language is a "systemic resource for meaning"
- Linguistics is the study of meaning-exchange through language
 
</div>

</div>

---

### Danish structuralism


<div id = "left">
- Louis Hjelmslev (1899-1965)
- Copenhagen school of linguistics
- Inspired by the Prague school
- Followed in Sausurre's footsteps
- Went the formalist route (unlike Firth)

</div>


<div id = "right">

### American structuralism

- Franz Boas (1858–1942)
- Edward Sapir (1884-1939)
- Leonard Bloomfield (1887-1949)


---

### Franz Boas


<div id = "left">

- Cultural relativity
- Main concern was to gather information on the languages and cultures Native Americans before they disappeared

</div>

<div id = "right">

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/FranzBoas.jpg/440px-FranzBoas.jpg" width=""/>

</div>

---

### Edward Sapir

<div id = "left">
- Student of Boas
- Studied Native American languages
- Languages should be described in their own terms, not with European categories

</div>


<div id = "right">

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Edward_Sapir.jpg" width=""/>

</div>


---

### Leonard Bloomfield 

<div id = "left">

- Sanskrit scholar (big Pānini fan!)
- Primary concern was to establish linguistics as a science
- Heavily influenced by the mechanistic outlook of behaviourist psychology
- Strict empiricist (neo-Humian)
- No interest in semantics (meaning) or mentalism (psychology)

## Rejection of structuralism

<div id = "left">

- Noam Chomsky’s 1957 _Syntactic structures_
- Rejection of behaviourism
- Rise of Generative Linguistics
- Language does not arise from a community of speakers (a lá Saussure)
- Language == Grammar
