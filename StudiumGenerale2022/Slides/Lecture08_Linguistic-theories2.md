# Sapir-Whorf hypothesis

## Early Sapir



```
In his popular book Language, indeed, Sapir suggests that differences between languages are merely differences in modes of expressing a common range of experiences, rather than corresponding to differences in the experiences themselves

Sampson (1980)

```


---

## Later Sapir

```

The fact of the matter is that the 'real world' is to a large extent unconsciously built up on the language habits of the group. No two languages are ever sufficiently similar to be considered as representing the same social reality. The worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds, not merely the same world with different labels attached.

- Sapir (1929), quoted in Sampson (1980)

```


---

## Later Sapir

```
 

Such categories as number, gender, case, tense, ... are not so much discovered in experience as imposed upon it because of the tyrannical hold that linguistic form has upon our orientation in the world.

- Sapir (1929), quoted in Sampson (1980)

```

## Whorf

Takes Sapir literally.

Cryptotypes

## Whorf

Cryptotypes example:  

English country and town names cannot be replaced with pronouns after _in, at, to,_ or _from_

## Whorf

<div id = "left">
Animate / inanimate distinction is a cryptotype in Hopi.

Pluralization depends on animacy.

Thus, Hopi believe clouds to be alive.

## Whorf

Problems with this argument?

## Time in Hopi

<div id = "left">

- no spatial metaphors for time
- no counting of time units
- with no time references, no speed references

</div>

<div id = "right">

Do (did) Hopi speakers have a fundamentally different conception of the universe, and the nature of physics?
