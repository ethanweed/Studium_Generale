# Ancient Linguistics



---

## Indian tradition

---

### Pānini

- 7th to 4th century BCE
- Somewhere in what is now Pakistan?
- _Aṣtādhyāyī_: prescriptive grammar of Sanskrit

---

### Pānini

- Early formalist
- Morphology: abstract rules of word formation
- Phonology: pronunciation of words in isolation and in context

---

### Bhartṛhari

- 5th century BCE
- Vākyapadīya: Sanskrit grammar
- _Sphoṭa_: "bursts" or "spurts": how the mind groups language units in comprehension

---

### Bhartṛhari

- _varṇa-sphoṭa_: syllables
- _pada-sphoṭa_: words
- _vakya-sphoṭa_: sentences

---

### Bhartṛhari

- Thought and language
- Sign: signifier and signified
- Inspiration for Saussure?

---

## Linguistics in ancient Greece 

---

 ``The ancient Greeks had the gift of wondering at things that other people take for granted - Bloomfield (1935)``

---

### Linguistics in ancient Greece  

<div id = "left">

What is...
 
* the origin of language?  
* the relation between language and thought?  
* the relation between form and meaning?

</div>

### Plato's _Cratylus_

Is language "natural" or "conventional"?

---

### Plato's _Cratylus_


```
HERMOGENES: That's right.
SOCRATES: Because it seems that there's a type of shuttle that's naturally
suited to each type of weaving. And the same holds of tools in general.
HERMOGENES: Yes.
SOCRATES: So mustn't a rule-setter also know how to embody in sounds
and syllables the name naturally suited to each thing?

```

---

### Ancient Greek grammar

  Word-based: 

* Identification of the word as a linguistic entity  
* Establishment of word classes – parts of speech  
* Establishment of grammatical categories to describe the morphology of the words in the paradigms, and their syntax of combination

##    Dionysius Thrax

-  ca. 100 BCE
- _Téchnē grammatiké_: first know description of a European language (Greek)
- Defined European grammar for 13 centuries
- word-based (little to nothing on syntax)

---

##    Dionysius Thrax

##   Apollonius Dyscolus

- ca. 100 CE
- Assigned grammatical structure to meaning
- Syntactic description built on relation of noun and verb to one another

---

##   Apollonius Dyscolus

- Active verbs: actions “passing over to something or someone else”
- Foreshadows distinctions of subject and object
- Evidence of hierarchical structure of sentences, and notion of constituency

---

```

   [Ancient Greeks'] achievement in that part of linguistics in which they were strongest, namely grammatical theory and grammatical description, is strong enough to deserve and to sustain critical examination. It is also such as to inspire our gratitude and admiration. - Robins (1967)

```
