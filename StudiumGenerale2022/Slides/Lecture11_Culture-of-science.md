## Science as induction

## What is induction?

**Deduction**: If the premises are correct, the conclusion is _certain_  

**Induction**: If the premises are correct, the conclusion in _probable_

Carl Hempel (1905 - 1997)

---

## Logical positivism 

- Hempel was a leading figure
- Impressed by the scientific advances of early C20 (e.g. Einstein)
- Wanted to make philosophy more “scientific”


---

## Logical positivists


- Impressed by the apparent objectivity of science
- Questions can be settled objectively
- Science is entirely rational: the route to truth

Induction can _never_ prove a theory right. What we _can_ do is use experimentation and induction to find evidence _against_ a theory.

## Normal science


<div id = "left">

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/87/Thomas_Kuhn.jpg" width=""/>

</div>


<div id = "right">

- Normal science is what most scientist do most of the time.
- Normal science operates within a scientific _paradigm_

</div>

---

## Paradigm shifts

1. First, a new paradigm offers the promise of success
1. Then, normal science makes good on that promise by
	- filling in details
	- expanding on certain aspects
	- refining theoretical points
	- "mopping up"


---

## Normal science is what most scientists do all their lives!

---



::: {.incremental}
- Our image of a scientist is Einstein or Newton making big discoveries
- Most scientists don't make big discoveries
- Most scientists don't even *try* to make big discoveries

:::

---

## Normal science as puzzle-solving

In normal science, we often just try to demonstrate what we already believe

::: {.incremental}

- scientists are part of a community that "believes" in the dominant paradigm
- if you get a finding that seems too strange, it might not get published


:::



---

## Normal science as puzzle-solving

::: {.incremental}

- Doing normal science within the dominant paradigm gives the comfort that the problem we are working on actually has a solution
- We gain success from solving puzzles
- It is unpopular to say that a puzzle can't be solved
- Scientists do science because they like solving puzzles

:::




---

## Paradigms

1. Paradigms give coherence to scientific activity
1. Scientists can disagree on all sorts of things, while still remaining within the paradigm
1. Paradigms fill in many of the "elliptical" elements of scientific explanation
1. Paradigms can be cross-disciplinary and have different meanings for different disciplines


---

## Paradigm shifts

1. Scientists don't look for anomalies
1. But sometimes they find them
1. After a while, there begin to be so many anomalies, that the dominant paradigm is called into question
1. Paradigm shift brings resistance
1. But notice: without a dominant paradigm *anomalies would not be anomalies!*


---

## Crisis

- Crises do not usually sneak up on a scientific community 

- Scientists can respond in many different ways:

::: {.incremental}

- dig in and resist
- give up
- try to keep modifying the dominant paradigm *ad hoc*
- borrow ideas from a different branch of science

## New paradigms

1. Allow researchers to see old problems in new ways
1. Can make old problems irrelevant
1. Raise entirely new questions


---

## The invisibility of paradigms

1. Paradigms are tacit
1. Paradigms are larger than we think
1. The general public in particular may be unaware of scientific paradigms, although they are influenced by them

	Therefore we are neither very far from nor very close to the field site. We are at a good distance, and we have transported a small number of pertinent features. During the transportation something has been preserved. If I can manage to grasp this invariant, this je ne sais quoi, I believe, I will have understood scientific reference. In this little room where the botanist shelters her collection (Figure 2.6) is a table, similar to that in the restaurant, on which the specimens brought back from distinct locations at different times are now displayed. Philosophy, the art of wonderment, should consider this table carefully, since it is where we see why the botanist gains so much more from her collection than she loses by distancing herself from the forest. Let us first review what we know of that superiority before again attempting to follow the intermediary steps.
	
	The first advantage: comfort. In leafing through the pages of news print, the researcher makes the dried stems and flowers visible so she can examine them at leisure, writing just beside them as if the stems and flowers could imprint themselves directly onto the paper or at least become compatible with the paper world. The supposedly vast
	distance between writing and things is now only a few centimeters.
	
	A second advantage, just as important, is that once classified, specimens from different locations and times become contemporaries of one another on the flat table, all visible under the same unifying gaze. This plant, classified three years ago, and this other, obtained more a than a thousand kilometers away, conspire on the table to form a synoptic tableau.
	
	A third advantage, again equally decisive, is that the researcher can shift the position of specimens and substitute one for another as if shuffling cards. Plants are not exactly signs, yet they have become as mobile and recombinable as the lead monotype characters of a printing press.
	
	Hardly surprising, then, that in the calm and cool office the botanist who patiently arranges the leaves is able to discern emerging patterns that no predecessor could see. The contrary would be much more surprising. Innovations in knowledge naturally emerge from the collection deployed on the table (Eisenstein 1979). In the forest, in the same world but with all of its trees, plants, roots, soil, and worms, the botanist could not calmly arrange the pieces of her jigsaw puzzle on her card table. Scattered through time and space, these leaves would never have met without her redistributing their traits into new combinations.
	
	At the card table, with so many trumps in hand, every scientist becomes a structuralist. No need to look any further for the martingale that wins every time against those who sweat in the forest, those crushed beneath the complex phenomena that are maddeningly present, indiscernible, impossible to identify, reshuffle, and control. In losing the forest, we win knowledge of it. In a beautiful contradiction, the English word "oversight" exactly captures the two meanings of this domination by sight, since it means at once looking at something from above and ignoring it.
