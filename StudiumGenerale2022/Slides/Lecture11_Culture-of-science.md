## Science as induction

---

## What is induction?

**Deduction**: If the premises are correct, the conclusion is _certain_  

**Induction**: If the premises are correct, the conclusion in _probable_

There is *no* amount of evidence that will ever be enough for us to justify believing a theory without a shadow of a doubt.

Carl Hempel (1905 - 1997)

</div>

---

## Logical positivism 

- Hempel was a leading figure
- Impressed by the scientific advances of early C20 (e.g. Einstein)
- Wanted to make philosophy more “scientific”


---

## Logical positivists


- Impressed by the apparent objectivity of science
- Questions can be settled objectively
- Science is entirely rational: the route to truth


---


## Critical Rationalism

Karl Popper (1902-1994)

Induction can _never_ prove a theory right. What we _can_ do is use experimentation and induction to find evidence _against_ a theory.

the scientific status of a theory is its falsifiability, or refutability, or testability.

Those among us who are unwilling to expose their ideas to the hazards of refutation do not take part in the game of science

## Normal science


<div id = "left">

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/87/Thomas_Kuhn.jpg" width=""/>

</div>


<div id = "right">

- Normal science is what most scientist do most of the time.
- Normal science operates within a scientific _paradigm_

</div>

---

## Paradigm shifts

1. First, a new paradigm offers the promise of success
1. Then, normal science makes good on that promise by
	- filling in details
	- expanding on certain aspects
	- refining theoretical points
	- "mopping up"


---

## Normal science is what most scientists do all their lives!

---



::: {.incremental}
- Our image of a scientist is Einstein or Newton making big discoveries
- Most scientists don't make big discoveries
- Most scientists don't even *try* to make big discoveries

:::

---

## Normal science as puzzle-solving

In normal science, we often just try to demonstrate what we already believe

::: {.incremental}

- scientists are part of a community that "believes" in the dominant paradigm
- if you get a finding that seems too strange, it might not get published


:::



---

## Normal science as puzzle-solving

::: {.incremental}

- Doing normal science within the dominant paradigm gives the comfort that the problem we are working on actually has a solution
- We gain success from solving puzzles
- It is unpopular to say that a puzzle can't be solved
- Scientists do science because they like solving puzzles

:::




---

## Paradigms

1. Paradigms give coherence to scientific activity
1. Scientists can disagree on all sorts of things, while still remaining within the paradigm
1. Paradigms fill in many of the "elliptical" elements of scientific explanation
1. Paradigms can be cross-disciplinary and have different meanings for different disciplines


---

## Paradigm shifts

1. Scientists don't look for anomalies
1. But sometimes they find them
1. After a while, there begin to be so many anomalies, that the dominant paradigm is called into question
1. Paradigm shift brings resistance
1. But notice: without a dominant paradigm *anomalies would not be anomalies!*


---

## Crisis

- Crises do not usually sneak up on a scientific community 

- Scientists can respond in many different ways:

::: {.incremental}

- dig in and resist
- give up
- try to keep modifying the dominant paradigm *ad hoc*
- borrow ideas from a different branch of science

## New paradigms

1. Allow researchers to see old problems in new ways
1. Can make old problems irrelevant
1. Raise entirely new questions


---

## The invisibility of paradigms

1. Paradigms are tacit
1. Paradigms are larger than we think
1. The general public in particular may be unaware of scientific paradigms, although they are influenced by them

No, I would say clayey, sandy, no sandy-clay."
Wat, mold it a bit more, give it some time.'
0 ay, yes, let's say between sandy-clay and clayey-sand."
