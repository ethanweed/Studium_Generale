<h2>“Science”</h2>
<div id="left">
<pre><code>
Our present use of the word ‘science’ was first coined in the nineteenth century and, strictly speaking, there was no such thing as ‘science’ in our sense in the early modern period. To talk as though there was, as I have been doing, is an obviously whiggish distortion. Part of our aim, in looking at the historical development of what we think of as science, should be to understand how the very concept ‘science’ arose; we simply beg the question if we talk about ‘science’ as though it always existed.

<pre><code>   Science, since people must do it, is a socially embedded activity. It progresses by hunch, vision, and intuition. Much of its change through time does not record a closer approach to absolute truth, but the alteration of cultural contexts that influence it so strongly. Facts are not pure and unsullied bits of information; culture also influences what we see and how we see it. Theories, moreover, are not inexorable inductions from facts. The most creative theories are often imaginative visions imposed upon facts; the source of imagination is also strongly cultural.

<h1>Patterns in Nature</h1>

</section>
<section id="the-context-of-science" class="slide level2">
<h2>The context of science</h2>
<p>The natural philosopher of the Middle Ages or of the Scientific Revolution studied the natural world – as modern scientists do – but did so within a wider vision that included theology and metaphysics. The three components of God, man, and nature were never insulated from one another. Natural philosophical outlooks gradually gave way to more specialized and narrow ‘scientific’ ones only during the 19th century (the age in which the word ‘scientist’ was first coined). The work and motivations of early modern natural philosophers cannot be properly understood or appreciated without keeping the distinct character of natural philosophy in mind. Their questions and goals were not necessarily our questions and goals, even when the very same natural objects were being studied. Hence, the history of science cannot be written by pulling scientific ‘firsts’ out of their historical context, but only by seeing with eyes and minds of our historical characters.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-sunflower-and-the-sun" class="slide level2">
<h2>The sunflower and the sun</h2>
<p>Magia is perhaps best translated for moderns as ‘mastery’. The goal of the practitioner of magia, called a magus, is to learn and to control the connections embedded in the world in order to manipulate them for practical ends. Look again at Kircher’s frontispiece. In the upper left-hand corner, magia naturalis is listed among the branches of knowledge, between arithmetic and medicine. Kircher symbolizes it with the turning of a sunflower to follow the Sun across the sky throughout the day. (Several plants display this behaviour, known as heliotropism.) Why does the sunflower always turn towards the Sun while most plants do not? Clearly, there must be some special link between Sun and sunflower. The ability of the sunflower to follow the Sun provided a prime example of the hidden connections and forces in the world that the magus endeavoured to identify and control.</p>
<p>## Hidden knots in nature (<em>magia naturalis</em>) Given the immense variety of nature, the task of the aspiring magus is mind- bogglingly immense – no less than cataloguing the properties of everything. Could there be a shortcut? Some natural philosophers believed that nature contained clues to guide the magus, perhaps as hints implanted there by a merciful God who wants us to understand His creation and benefit from it. The doctrine of signatures claims that some natural objects are ‘signed’ with indications of their hidden qualities. Often, this means that two connected objects look somehow similar, or have some analogous characteristics; for example, the sunflower not only follows the Sun, its blossom actually resembles the Sun in colour and shape. Various parts of plants resemble various parts of the human body; a walnut nestled in its shell looks remarkably like a brain inside the skull. Is this a sign that walnuts would provide good medicines for the brain? The practitioner of magia would have to try these things out to be sure, but observation coupled with the idea of signatures provided a useful point of departure for investigating, explaining, and using the natural world.</p>
<h3 id="god-as-a-romance-author">God as a Romance author</h3>
<p>The English natural philosopher Robert Boyle (1627–91), renowned for his work in chemistry (chemistry students still have to learn Boyle’s Law that the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure exerted upon it), wrote that the world is like ‘a well contriv’d Romance’. Here, Boyle alludes to the massive French novels of his day (of which he was very fond). These romances often run to more than two thousand pages in length, and feature a memory-taxing myriad of characters whose complex storylines constantly converge and diverge in surprising ways, full of revelations about who is secretly in love with whom and who is really whose long-lost brother, child, or what-not. For Boyle, the Creator is the ultimate romance writer, and scientific investigators are the readers trying to figure out all the relationships and crisscrossing storylines in the world He wrote.</p>
</section>
<section id="good-induction-wrong-conclusions" class="slide level2">
<h2>Good induction, wrong conclusions</h2>
<p>At the present time, applications of magia naturalis and the whole idea of an interconnected world of sympathies and analogies are sometimes dismissed as irrational or superstitious. But this harsh judgement is faulty. It results from a certain smug arrogance and a failure to exercise historical understanding. What our predecessors did was to observe various mysterious and apparently similar phenomena in nature and to extrapolate thence into a more universal statement – a law of nature – about connections and the transmission of influences in the world. This extrapolation led to one tenet that they held that we do not; namely, that similar or analogous objects silently exert influence upon one another. Once that assumption is made, then the rest of the system builds upon it rationally. They were trying to understand the world; they were trying to make sense of things and to make use of the powers of nature. They moved inductively from observed or reported instances to a general principle and then deductively to its consequences and applications. We might choose to say, informed as we are by more recent studies, that the action between Sun and sunflower, or Moon and sea, or magnet and iron, can be better explained by something other than hidden knots of sympathy. But that does not permit us to say that their methods or conclusions were irrational, or that the beliefs and practices that came from them were ‘superstitious’. If that leap were allowed, then every scientific theory that comes ultimately to be rejected in the course of the development of our understanding of the world – no doubt including some things that we today believe to be true explanations of phenomena – would have to be judged irrational and superstitious as well, rather than simply mistaken notions that were arrived at rationally given the ideas, perspectives, and information available at the time.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-scientist-priest" class="slide level2">
<h2>The scientist-priest</h2>
<p>Robert Boyle, for example, considered his scientific inquiries to be a type of religious devotion (and thus particularly appropriate to do on Sundays) that heightens the natural philosopher’s knowledge and awareness of God through the contemplation of His creation. He described the natural philosopher as a ‘priest of nature’ whose duty it was to expound and interpret the messages written in the Book of Nature, and to gather together and give voice to all creation’s silent praise of its Creator.</p>
