<h3 id="studium-generale">Studium Generale</h3>
<pre><code> 

The term studium generale, or studium was used to designate universities early on, and referred to the school’s ability to attract students from a broad geographical area, as opposed to a provincial studium particulare, and those studia of the friars.

<h3 id="university">“University”</h3>
<pre><code> 
the term universitas in the medieval context was the term for a guild or a corporation, and was borrowed from Roman law,16 and, as Leff notes, “had no specific application to a university” in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, but rather “connoted any corporate body or group with an independent juridical status. It could be constituted from three or more persons in a profession who could form their own association (collegium) to protect their rights.”

<pre><code>
About 30 years ago there was much talk that Geologists ought only to observe &amp; not theorise &amp; I well remember some one saying, that at this rate a man might as well go into a gravel-pit &amp; count the pebbles &amp; describe their colours. How odd it is that every one should not see that all observation must be for or against some view, if it is to be of any service.

<h3 id="theory-construction-data-collection-1">Theory-construction &amp; data collection</h3>
<pre><code>

If we consider the origin of our knowledge, it is no less certain that … [as] every positive theory must necessarily be founded upon observations, it is, on the other hand, no less true that, in order to observe, our mind has need of some theory or others. If in contemplating phenomena we did not immediately connect them with some principles, not only would it be impossible for us to combine these isolated observations and, therefore, to derive any profit from them, but we should even be entirely incapable of remembering the facts, which would for the most part remain unnoted by us.

The realization that natural science is not indubitable epistēmē (scientia) has led to the view that it is technē(technique, art, technology); but the proper view, I believe, is that it consists of doxai (opinions, conjectures),controlled by critical discussion as well as by experimental technē

<p>Dawson and Stapel: Telling us what we want to hear.</p>
<pre><code>
 

“I didn’t do strange stuff, I never said let’s do an experiment to show that the earth is flat,” he said. “I always checked — this may be by a cunning manipulative mind — that the experiment was reasonable, that it followed from the research that had come before, that it was just this extra step that everybody was waiting for.” He always read the research literature extensively to generate his hypotheses. “So that it was believable and could be argued that this was the only logical thing you would find,” he said. “Everybody wants you to be novel and creative, but you also need to be truthful and likely. You need to be able to say that this is completely new and exciting, but it’s very likely given what we know so far.”

-Stapel, quoted in Bhattacharjee (2013)
