<pre><code> 

The term studium generale, or studium was used to designate universities early on, and referred to the school’s ability to attract students from a broad geographical area, as opposed to a provincial studium particulare, and those studia of the friars.

<h3 id="university">“University”</h3>
<pre><code> 
the term universitas in the medieval context was the term for a guild or a corporation, and was borrowed from Roman law,16 and, as Leff notes, “had no specific application to a university” in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, but rather “connoted any corporate body or group with an independent juridical status. It could be constituted from three or more persons in a profession who could form their own association (collegium) to protect their rights.”

<pre><code>
About 30 years ago there was much talk that Geologists ought only to observe &amp; not theorise &amp; I well remember some one saying, that at this rate a man might as well go into a gravel-pit &amp; count the pebbles &amp; describe their colours. How odd it is that every one should not see that all observation must be for or against some view, if it is to be of any service.

<h3 id="theory-construction-data-collection-1">Theory-construction &amp; data collection</h3>
<pre><code>

If we consider the origin of our knowledge, it is no less certain that … [as] every positive theory must necessarily be founded upon observations, it is, on the other hand, no less true that, in order to observe, our mind has need of some theory or others. If in contemplating phenomena we did not immediately connect them with some principles, not only would it be impossible for us to combine these isolated observations and, therefore, to derive any profit from them, but we should even be entirely incapable of remembering the facts, which would for the most part remain unnoted by us.
