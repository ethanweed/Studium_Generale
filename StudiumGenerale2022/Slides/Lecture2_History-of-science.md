## "Science"
<div id = "left">

```

Our present use of the word ‘science’ was first coined in the nineteenth century and, strictly speaking, there was no such thing as ‘science’ in our sense in the early modern period. To talk as though there was, as I have been doing, is an obviously whiggish distortion. Part of our aim, in looking at the historical development of what we think of as science, should be to understand how the very concept ‘science’ arose; we simply beg the question if we talk about ‘science’ as though it always existed.

## "Science"

### science (n.)

```
mid-14c., "what is known, knowledge (of something) acquired by study; information;" also "assurance of knowledge, certitude, certainty," from Old French science "knowledge, learning, application; corpus of human knowledge" (12c.), from Latin scientia "knowledge, a knowing; expertness," from sciens(genitive scientis) "intelligent, skilled," present participle of scire "to know," probably originally "to separate one thing from another, to distinguish," related to scindere "to cut, divide" (from PIE root [*skei-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*skei-?ref=etymonline_crossreference "Etymology, meaning and definition of *skei- ") "to cut, split;" source also of Greek skhizein "to split, rend, cleave," Gothic skaidan, Old English sceadan "to divide, separate").

Oldest known usage of "scientist"

This second ‘rebirth’ was the ‘Renaissance of the Twelfth Century’, a great explosion of creativity in the sciences, technology, theology, music, art, education, architecture, law, and literature. The triggers for this efflorescence remain open to debate. Some scholars point to a warmer, more favourable climate for Europe beginning in the 11th century (called the ‘Medieval Warm Period’) coupled with improvements in agriculture that brought enough food and prosperity for Europe’s population to double and perhaps triple within a relatively short time. The rise of urban centres, more stable social and political systems, more abundant food, and thus more time for thought and scholarship, all contributed to initiating this Renaissance.

 
## The University 
The importance of the university as an institutional home for scholarship cannot be overemphasized. As the prominent scholar Edward Grant writes, the medieval university ‘shaped the intellectual life of Western Europe’. While the highest degree in the university was in theology, one could not become a theologian without first mastering the logic, mathematics, and natural philosophy of the day, since those topics were employed routinely in the advanced Christian theology of the Middle Ages. Indeed, most great natural philosophers of the period were doctors of theology: St Albert the Great (now patron saint of natural scientists), Theodoric of Freiburg, Nicole Oresme, Henry of Langenstein. All these figures were educated in, taught in, and found a home in a university.

 
## The concept of the Middle Ages
it was humanist historians of the Italian Renaissance – such as the Florentines Leonardo Bruni (1369–1444) and Flavio Biondo (1392–1463) – who devised the three-fold periodization of history with which we are all familiar (and from whose implications we still must struggle to free ourselves). According to this periodization, the antiquity of Greece and Rome constitutes the first era, while the third era is that of modernity, beginning of course with the Renaissance authors themselves. Falling between these two high points, according to the humanists, lies a ‘middle’ period of dullness and stagnation, which is thus called the ‘Middle’ Ages. Indeed, perhaps the most enduring invention of the Renaissance has been the concept of the Middle Ages, to the extent that we have no name for the period 500 to 1300 that is not suffused with the disdain Italian humanists felt towards it. Given the recent memory of famine and plague years as their immediate background, the restoration of prosperity in Italy around 1400 must surely have seemed the dawn of a ‘new age’.

 
## Movable Type
Johannes Gutenberg (c. 1398–1468), originally a goldsmith in Mainz. The key to movable-type printing was the creation of cast metal type, each bearing a single raised letter. These type could be assembled into full pages of text, their surfaces smeared with an oil-based ink and pressed against paper, thus printing an entire page (or set of pages) at once. After printing numerous copies, the page of type could be taken apart and the letters readily rearranged into the next set of pages. Previously, books had to be copied by hand, resulting in slow production and high price.


## Literacy
Printing presses sprang up rapidly across Europe. By 1500, there were about a thousand in operation, and between thirty and forty thousand titles had been printed, representing roughly ten million books. This flood of printed material only increased throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. Books became steadily less expensive (often with a loss of quality) and easier for less wealthy buyers to obtain. Printing allowed for faster communication through broadsides, newsletters, pamphlets, periodicals, and a slew of other paper ephemera. Although most of these ephemera perished soon after their production (like last week’s newspaper), such items were very common in the early modern period. The press thus created a new world of the printed word – and of literacy – like never before known.

## Printed diagrams
One easily overlooked feature of printing was its ability to reproduce images and diagrams. Illustrations posed a problem for the manuscript tradition since the ability to render drawings accurately depended upon the copyist’s draftsmanship, and often upon his understanding of the text. Consequently, every copy meant degradation for anatomical renderings, botanical and zoological illustrations, maps, charts, and mathematical or technological diagrams. Some copyists simply omitted difficult graphics. Printing meant that an author could oversee the production of a master woodcut or engraving, which could then produce identical copies easily and reliably. Under such conditions, authors were more willing and able to include images in their texts, enabling the growth of scientific illustration for the first time.

 
##  New information from the New World
It is hard to imagine the flood of data that poured into Europe from the New World. New plants, new animals, new minerals, new medicines, and reports of new peoples, languages, ideas, observations, and phenomena overwhelmed the Old World’s ability to digest them. This was true ‘information overload’, and it demanded revisions to ideas about the natural world and new methods for organizing knowledge. Traditional systems of classifying plants and animals were exploded by the discovery of new and bizarre creatures. Observations of human habitation virtually everywhere explorers could reach refuted the ancient notion that the world was divided into five climatic regions – two temperate ones and three rendered uninhabitable due to excessive heat or cold.


# Patterns in Nature

 
## The context of science
The natural philosopher of the Middle Ages or of the Scientific Revolution studied the natural world – as modern scientists do – but did so within a wider vision that included theology and metaphysics. The three components of God, man, and nature were never insulated from one another. Natural philosophical outlooks gradually gave way to more specialized and narrow ‘scientific’ ones only during the 19th century (the age in which the word ‘scientist’ was first coined). The work and motivations of early modern natural philosophers cannot be properly understood or appreciated without keeping the distinct character of natural philosophy in mind. Their questions and goals were not necessarily our questions and goals, even when the very same natural objects were being studied. Hence, the history of science cannot be written by pulling scientific ‘firsts’ out of their historical context, but only by seeing with eyes and minds of our historical characters.

## The sunflower and the sun
 
Magia is perhaps best translated for moderns as ‘mastery’. The goal of the practitioner of magia, called a magus, is to learn and to control the connections embedded in the world in order to manipulate them for practical ends. Look again at Kircher’s frontispiece. In the upper left-hand corner, magia naturalis is listed among the branches of knowledge, between arithmetic and medicine. Kircher symbolizes it with the turning of a sunflower to follow the Sun across the sky throughout the day. (Several plants display this behaviour, known as heliotropism.) Why does the sunflower always turn towards the Sun while most plants do not? Clearly, there must be some special link between Sun and sunflower. The ability of the sunflower to follow the Sun provided a prime example of the hidden connections and forces in the world that the magus endeavoured to identify and control.


 ## Hidden knots in nature (_magia naturalis_)
Given the immense variety of nature, the task of the aspiring magus is mind- bogglingly immense – no less than cataloguing the properties of everything. Could there be a shortcut? Some natural philosophers believed that nature contained clues to guide the magus, perhaps as hints implanted there by a merciful God who wants us to understand His creation and benefit from it. The doctrine of signatures claims that some natural objects are ‘signed’ with indications of their hidden qualities. Often, this means that two connected objects look somehow similar, or have some analogous characteristics; for example, the sunflower not only follows the Sun, its blossom actually resembles the Sun in colour and shape. Various parts of plants resemble various parts of the human body; a walnut nestled in its shell looks remarkably like a brain inside the skull. Is this a sign that walnuts would provide good medicines for the brain? The practitioner of magia would have to try these things out to be sure, but observation coupled with the idea of signatures provided a useful point of departure for investigating, explaining, and using the natural world.


### God as a Romance author
The English natural philosopher Robert Boyle (1627–91), renowned for his work in chemistry (chemistry students still have to learn Boyle’s Law that the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure exerted upon it), wrote that the world is like ‘a well contriv’d Romance’. Here, Boyle alludes to the massive French novels of his day (of which he was very fond). These romances often run to more than two thousand pages in length, and feature a memory-taxing myriad of characters whose complex storylines constantly converge and diverge in surprising ways, full of revelations about who is secretly in love with whom and who is really whose long-lost brother, child, or what-not. For Boyle, the Creator is the ultimate romance writer, and scientific investigators are the readers trying to figure out all the relationships and crisscrossing storylines in the world He wrote.

## Good induction, wrong conclusions
At the present time, applications of magia naturalis and the whole idea of an interconnected world of sympathies and analogies are sometimes dismissed as irrational or superstitious. But this harsh judgement is faulty. It results from a certain smug arrogance and a failure to exercise historical understanding. What our predecessors did was to observe various mysterious and apparently similar phenomena in nature and to extrapolate thence into a more universal statement – a law of nature – about connections and the transmission of influences in the world. This extrapolation led to one tenet that they held that we do not; namely, that similar or analogous objects silently exert influence upon one another. Once that assumption is made, then the rest of the system builds upon it rationally. They were trying to understand the world; they were trying to make sense of things and to make use of the powers of nature. They moved inductively from observed or reported instances to a general principle and then deductively to its consequences and applications. We might choose to say, informed as we are by more recent studies, that the action between Sun and sunflower, or Moon and sea, or magnet and iron, can be better explained by something other than hidden knots of sympathy. But that does not permit us to say that their methods or conclusions were irrational, or that the beliefs and practices that came from them were ‘superstitious’. If that leap were allowed, then every scientific theory that comes ultimately to be rejected in the course of the development of our understanding of the world – no doubt including some things that we today believe to be true explanations of phenomena – would have to be judged irrational and superstitious as well, rather than simply mistaken notions that were arrived at rationally given the ideas, perspectives, and information available at the time.

## The scientist-priest
Robert Boyle, for example, considered his scientific inquiries to be a type of religious devotion (and thus particularly appropriate to do on Sundays) that heightens the natural philosopher’s knowledge and awareness
of God through the contemplation of His creation. He described the natural philosopher as a ‘priest of nature’ whose duty it was to expound and interpret the messages written in the Book of Nature, and to gather together and give voice to all creation’s silent praise of its Creator.
