Our present use of the word ‘science’ was first coined in the nineteenth century and, strictly speaking, there was no such thing as ‘science’ in our sense in the early modern period. To talk as though there was, as I have been doing, is an obviously whiggish distortion. Part of our aim, in looking at the historical development of what we think of as science, should be to understand how the very concept ‘science’ arose; we simply beg the question if we talk about ‘science’ as though it always existed.

Oxford English Dictionary

```
1834   W. Whewell in _Q. Rev._ **51** 59   Science..loses all traces of unity. A curious illustration of this result may be observed in the want of any name by which we can designate the students of the knowledge of the material world collectively. We are informed that this difficulty was felt very oppressively by the members of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, at their meetings..in the last three summers... _Philosophers_ was felt to be too wide and too lofty a term,..; "savans" was rather assuming,..; some ingenious gentleman proposed that, by analogy with "artist", they might form "scientist" [...]
