Our present use of the word ‘science’ was first coined in the nineteenth century and, strictly speaking, there was no such thing as ‘science’ in our sense in the early modern period. To talk as though there was, as I have been doing, is an obviously whiggish distortion. Part of our aim, in looking at the historical development of what we think of as science, should be to understand how the very concept ‘science’ arose; we simply beg the question if we talk about ‘science’ as though it always existed.

Henry (2008)

- What does "whiggish" mean?
- What is the etymology of _science_ and _scientist_?
-  How do you understand the link between the word science and the concept of science in the first sentence of the quote – i.e. what do you think Henry means?
