<p>Dear Studium Generale students,</p>
<p>Welcome! My name is Ethan, and I will be teaching the course Studium Generale this semester. I imagine you are probably beginning to think about the coming semester, and starting to make plans, so I have opened up the Brightspace site for this course, and posted a tentative schedule. Note that I am adapting the course from the way Bill McGregor usually teaches it (after all, I’m not Bill—only Bill is Bill!), so I will be adding things, removing things, and making changes over the next few weeks. Nothing is set in stone yet, but the basic topics and readings probably won’t change much, and while I might add or substract an article or chapter here and there, I won’t change the overall <em>amount</em> of reading much from what is posted here.</p>
<p>I’ll add more information about the readings, the assignments, the exam, and all that good stuff soon. For now, just know that there is no textbook that you need to buy for this course: all the required readings will be made available for you, in one way or another.</p>
<p>More information is on its way—for now, welcome, and have a great weekend!</p>
<p>/Ethan</p>
