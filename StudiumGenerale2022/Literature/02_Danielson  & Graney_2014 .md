> For a long time after 1609, astronomers still had compelling
> sci- entific reasons to doubt Copernicus. Their tale offers a

> that turn out, in the end, to be spectac- ularly correct.

> A PARTICULARLY POWERFUL wellspring of doubt came courtesy of
> Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, who in 1588 proposed a different
> kind of geocentric system [see box at right]. This new
> “geoheliocentric” cosmology had two major advantages going for
> it: it squared with deep intuitions about how the world appeared
> to behave, and it fit the available data better than
> Copernicus’s system did.

> a mid-17th- century compilation by Albert Curtius of all
> astronomical data gathered since antiquity: the great bulk of
> two millennia’s worth of data came from Brahe.

> Brahe said that the Coper- nican system “expertly and completely
> cir- cumvents all that is superfluous or discor- dant in the
> system of Ptolemy.... Yet it as- cribes to the earth, that
> hulking, lazy body, unfit for motion, a motion as quick as that
> of the aethereal torches.”

> When we look up at the night sky, individual stars appear to
> have fixed widths, which both Ptolemy and Brahe measured. We now
> know that the distant stars are effectively point sources of
> light, and these apparent widths are an artifact of the passage
> of light waves through a circular aperture such as a telescope
> or an iris.

> Brahe used simple geometry to calculate that if the stars were
> to lie at Copernican distances, then they would have to have a
> width com- parable to that of the orbis magnus.

> This “Tychonic” system retained the advantages of geocentrism.
> With it there was no motion of the hulking, lazy Earth to
> explain. Neither was there any missing annual parallax demanding
> vastly distant, and giant, stars—the stars in Brahe’s system lay
> just beyond the planets and were quite reasonably sized

> Back in Galileo’s and Riccioli’s day, how- ever, those opposed
> to Copernicanism had some quite respectable, coherent, observa-
> tionally based science on their side. They were eventually
> proved wrong, but that did not make them bad scientists. In
> fact, rig- orously disproving the strong arguments of others was
> and is part of the challenge, as well as part of the fun, of
> doing science.
