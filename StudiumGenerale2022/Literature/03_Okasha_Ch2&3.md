> The newspaper report should really have said that scientists

> In this strict sense of the word, scientific hypotheses can
> rarely if ever be proved true by the data.

> Popperâ€™s basic argument was this. Although a scientific theory
> (or hypothesis) can never be proved true by a finite amount of
> data, it can be proved false, or refuted.

> And in order to do that, they will have to resort to inductive

> can get by without induction does not succeed.

> The 18th-century Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711â€“76) gave
> a simple but radical answer to this question. He argued that the
> use of induction cannot be rationally justified at all. Hume
> admitted that we use induction all the time, in everyday life
> and in science, but insisted that this was a matter of brute
> animal habit. If challenged to provide a good reason for using
> induction, we can give no satisfactory answer

> In each case, our reasoning seems to depend on the assumption
> that objects we havenâ€™t examined will be similar, in relevant
> respects, to objects of the same sort that we have examined.
> That assumption is what Hume means by the uniformity of nature.

> After all, the assumption has always held good up to now, so
> surely this is evidence that it is true? But this begs the
> question, says Hume! Grant that nature has behaved largely
> uniformly up to now. We cannot appeal to this fact to argue that
> nature will continue to be uniform, says Hume, because this
> assumes that what has happened in the past is a reliable guide
> to what will happen in the futureâ€”which is the uniformity of
> nature assumption.

Inference to the best explanation ~ abduction (C.S. Pierce)

First premises are known facts, but the others are only probable. E.g. crime investigation, medical diagnosis.

> One popular answer is that a good explanation should be simple,
> or parsimonious. Consider again the cheese-in-the-larder
> example. There are two pieces of data that need explaining: the
> missing cheese and the scratching noises. The mouse hypothesis
> postulates just one causeâ€”a mouseâ€”to explain both pieces of
> data.

#### [Page 11](highlights://03_Okasha_Ch2&3#page=11)

> But if scientists use simplicity as a guide to inference, this
> raises a deep question. Do we have reason to think that the
> universe is simple rather than complex?

> In modern biomedical science, a particular sort of controlled
> experiment is often given particular prominence. This is the
> randomized controlled trial (RCT), originally devised by R. A.
> Fisher in the 1930s, and often used to test the eectiveness of
> a new drug.

> The key feature of an RCT is that the initial division of the
> patients into two groups must be done at random. Fisher and his
> modern followers argue that this is necessary to sustain a valid
> causal inference.

#### [Page 15](highlights://03_Okasha_Ch2&3#page=15)

> Furthermore, much of the causal knowledge we have in everyday
> life we gained without RCTs. Young children know that putting
> their hand in the fire causes a painful burning sensation; no
> randomized trial was needed to establish this. While RCTs are
> certainly important, and should be done when feasible, it is not
> true that they are the only way of discovering causality.

> Hempelâ€™s account is known as the covering law model of
> explanation,

> The task of providing an account of scientific explanation then
> becomes the task of characterizing precisely the relation that
> must hold between a set of premises and a conclusion, in order
> for the former to count as an explanation of the latter.

> That was the problem Hempel set himself.

#### [Page 23](highlights://03_Okasha_Ch2&3#page=23)

> The phenomenon to be explained is called the explanandum, and
> the general laws and particular facts that do the explaining are
> called the explanans. The explanandum may be either particular
> or general.

#### [Page 25](highlights://03_Okasha_Ch2&3#page=25)

> Hempel expressed this by saying that every scientific
> explanation is potentially a predictionâ€”it would have served to
> predict the phenomenon in question, had it not already been
> known.

> The converse is also true, Hempel thought: every reliable
> prediction is potentially an explanation.

> it seems very odd to regard this as an explanation of why the

> deliberately made it soâ€”it has nothing to do with the length of

> allows something to count as a scientific explanation which
> obviously is not.

#### [Page 28](highlights://03_Okasha_Ch2&3#page=28)

> Hempelâ€™s model fails to capture fully what it is to be a
> scientific explanation, for it implies that explanation should
> be a symmetric relation when in fact it is asymmetric.

> If someone told you that it was casting a shadow of 20 metres
> and that the sun was 37Â° overhead, you would be able to predict
> the flagpoleâ€™s height, given that you knew the relevant optical
> and trigonometrical laws. But as we have just seen, this
> information clearly doesnâ€™t explain why the flagpole has the
> height it does.

> The general moral is that a good explanation of a phenomenon
> should contain information that is relevant to the phenomenonâ€™s
> occurrence. This is where the doctorâ€™s reply to the child goes

> Now causality is obviously an asymmetric relation too: if x is
> the cause of y, then y is not the cause of x.

#### [Page 31](highlights://03_Okasha_Ch2&3#page=31)

> Hempel subscribed to the philosophical doctrine called
> empiricism, and empiricists are traditionally suspicious of the
> concept of causality. Empiricism says that all our knowledge
> comes from experience.

> So he concluded that they donâ€™t existâ€”causality is something
> that we humans â€˜projectâ€™ onto the world! This is a very hard
> conclusion to accept. Surely it is an objective fact that
> dropping glass vases causes them to break? Hume denied this. He
> allowed that it is an objective fact that most glass vases which
> have been dropped have in fact broken. But our idea of causality
> includes more than this. It includes the idea of a causal
> connection between the dropping and the breaking, i.e. that the
> former brings about the latter.

#### [Page 32](highlights://03_Okasha_Ch2&3#page=32)

> Hume: all we see is a vase being dropped, and then it breaking a
> moment later.

> many philosophers have come to the conclusion that the concept
> of causality, although problematic, is indispensable to how we
> understand the world. So the idea of a causality-based account
> of scientific explanation seems more acceptable than it would
> have done in Hempelâ€™s day.

> When chemists discovered that water is H2O, they thereby
> explained what water is. Similarly, when physicists discovered
> that an objectâ€™s temperature is the average kinetic energy of
> its molecules, they thereby explained what temperature is. But
> neither of these explanations is causal. Being made of H2O
> doesnâ€™t cause a substance to be waterâ€”it just is being water.

> it is widely held that the dierent branches of science are not

#### [Page 37](highlights://03_Okasha_Ch2&3#page=37)

> This leads to a philosophical puzzle. How can a science which
