thought. There is a before Socrates and an after the before period
is popularly understood as being characterized by a fragmented
approach to knowledge, with the after Socrates period constituting
a more systematic and sophisticated approach. But the work of

Thales was important because he sought to explain the natural
world without reference to gods. He replaced the divine with the
physical. He proposed that the stuff of the universe was one primary,
organizing substance. He set off a tradition that made the search

for one irreducible substance a kind of grail quest in philosophy.
Aristotle would later say that several substances exist in their own
right, without being dependent upon any others. But the Presocratics
wanted one ultimate substance and it was variously proposed to be
water, fire, air or earth.

Ultimately, Christian philosophers of the medieval period
would replace the natural concept of ultimate substance with that
of God;

Another Presocratic idea that has had an enormous impact on
thinking right up until the present day is atomism: the idea that
the world is composed of indestructible, irreducible building blocks.
Atomism was first developed by Leucippus (early fifth century
B) and continued by his student Democritus (c.460-c.370 BC),
who believed that things are composed of atoms, which exist in
an infinite void (space). Aristotle would reject Democritus' form
of atomism because he thought it lacked a teleological order or
sense of direction. Teleology the notion that things have a
purpose, tending towards a perfect (or at least meaningful) end
was important for Plato and Aristotle, and the medieval Christian
philosophers. For Christian thinkers, the purpose of things was
to have been created by God and to fulfil his divine plan. Christian
resistance to Charles Darwin's theory of the origin of species
(1859) stemmed from its contradiction of the belief that species
exist in accordance with a preordained divine plan.

Socrates Plato's teacher challenged Athenians' received
opinions. As a result, he came to be admired and despised in equal
measure. Socrates philosophized in the street, at the marketplace, wherever men gathered to converse. His technique was to seize upon
a subject of the 'what is?' variety. What is good? What is virtue?
What is knowledge? His method was to encourage his interlocutor
to say what he thought those things might mean, and then, by a
series of cunning questions, get him to admit that he has no idea
what they mean after all. If it was any consolation to his partner
in dialogue, Socrates himself would usually admit that he did not
know the answer either. For many, participating in Socratic
dialogue was invigorating, exhilarating, the highest form of
activity. For others, however, it meant being embarrassed in public.
These people became enemies of Socrates.

Plato's key contribution was to look past sense experience and the
material world to identify what he called Forms. Forms are a type
of idea of things. For example, there is an ideal form of a chair;
but any chair we might sit upon is merely a pale and inadequate
representation of the ideal Form that exists for chairs. It is the
same for qualities and virtues, and the Form of good as conceived
by Plato is probably indistinguishable from God.

Aristotle: Plato's most famous pupil
As Socrates passed his knowledge to Plato, who acknowledged
his master and moved beyond him, so Aristotle, who spent twenty
years as Plato's student, surpassed his master, and went on to
become tutor to the young Alexander the Great (356-323 BC).
Aristotle created the first total system of philosophy, his work
setting the example (and the bar) for other great builders of philo
sophical systems of the future, like Kant and Hegel.

Aristotle's natural philosophy includes studies in physics,
cosmology and, especially, biology. In his Physics he explores the
nature of form and matter, and cause and effect. He posits the
idea of the unmoved mover: that which is behind all movement in
our universe. This became the argument of first cause, used by
the medieval Scholastic philosophers to describe God as creator
of the universe.
Aristotle's biological works are doubly important because they
(a) outline a method, and (b) constitute programme of research a
that bears results. His method was to categorize things according
to substance, species and genus. This not only provided the means
to catalogue plants and animals in a coherent way, it also implied
a teleological character in nature, along with a hierarchy that linked
man with some notion of the absolute (or God) above him, and lesser beings beneath him. This was the idea of the Great Chain
of Being, which placed God at the top, followed (in the later
Christian tradition) by various ranks of angels, then man, woman,
animals, plants, inorganic matter and, finally, chaos.

After this, mob persecution of Christians became a regular event;
when they refused to recant their beliefs and worship the gods of
Rome, they were put to death. This led to widespread martyrdom,
which had the effect of increasing Christianity's popularity. While
it may seem odd from a modern perspective, their belief in an after
life that promised heaven led many early Christians to welcome
an early death as preferable to their miserable existence on earth
(what today we would call their low socio-economic status). It
was not uncommon for groups of Christians to goad the Roman
authorities into killing them. The Roman consul Arrius Antonius
(C.AD 37-119) obliged several Christians when they demanded to

Now, for more than a millennium,
Christianity would maintain strict control over the development
of thought in the West.

Churches effectively replaced
the Academy as places of learning. Compared to the deep inquiries
of Democritus, Plato and Aristotle, what the Church had to offer
was dogma rather than unfettered philosophical inquiry. God was
the source of all things: that was to be the beginning and end of
all thought. This necessarily limited the scope of a philosopher's
work. Faith, not knowledge, became the ruling paradigm. The chal
lenge for Christian philosophers would be how to introduce philo
sophical inquiry inside a worldview that presupposed certain
clusions and was quick to punish those who departed from them.

The development of Christian theology as a philosophical prac
tice begins with St Augustine of Hippo (354-430), who is to be
credited with a number of firsts. While his place in the pantheon
of philosophers is assured, he is no less significant for having pub
lished the first autobiography. Augustine's Confessions (397-8) is
important not only because it contains a vital account of spiritual
and intellectual conversion to Christianity, but also because it is
the first text in which the first-person singular voice, the /, comes
into play in this form in Western thought. This is critical not only
because of its place in the history of genre writing, but because
it represents new attempt to find a human rather than divine a
ground for knowledge. The Confessions laid the ground for
Descartes' Discourse on Method (1637) more than a thousand years
later, in which Descartes formulated his famous declaration cogito
ergo sum: 'I think therefore I am', signalling the arrival of the
human subject at the centre of the world, rather than occupying
the peripheral, passive position of being acted upon.

The rise of Islam
At the beginning of the seventh century, Christianity faced a chal
lenge from a new monotheistic faith. Islam's adherents submitted
themselves to Allah, whom they regarded as the one true God.
Around 610 the Arabian Muhammad in 'Abdull h (c.570/1
632) received what he believed were revelations from God. Chased
out of Mecca, he fled to Medina in 622 (an event known as the
Hegira), where he founded an Islamic community. Thereafter Islam
spread swiftly throughout the region. After Muhammad's death,

Doctor Mirabilis (*wonderful teacher'). In 1267 Bacon presented
to Pope Clement IV (at the Pope's request) a manuscript of his
Opus Majus ('great work'), which outlined his scientific method
and put it in the context of theological and philosophical thought.
It was not published in its entirety until 1897. Bacon's work would
create a new standard for knowledge, in which hypotheses were
formulated and proved or disproved by experimentation.
