What is science?

Surely science is just the attempt to understand, explain, and
predict the world we live in? This is certainly a reasonable answer.
But is it the whole story? After all, the various religions also attempt
to understand and explain the world, but religion is not usually
regarded as a branch of science. Similarly, astrology and fortune
telling are attempts to predict the future, but most people would not
describe these activities as science. Or consider history. Historians
try to understand and explain what happened in the past, but
history is usually classified as an arts subject not a science subject.
As with many philosophical questions, the question 'what is
science?' turns out to be trickier than it looks at first sight.

times too the scientific revolution did not come from nowhere. In
these earlier periods the dominant world-view was Aristotelianism,
named after the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, who put
forward detailed theories in physics, biology, astronomy, and
cosmology. But Aristotle's ideas would seem very strange to a
modern scientist, as would his methods of enquiry. To pick just one
example, he believed that all earthly bodies are composed of just
four elements: earth, fire, air, and water. This view is obviously at
odds with what modern chemistry tells us.

Taken together, Kepler's laws provided a far superior planetary
theory than had ever been advanced before, solving problems that
had confounded astronomers for centuries. Galileo was a life-long
supporter of Copernicanism, and one of the early pioneers of the
telescope. When he pointed his telescope at the heavens, he made a
wealth of amazing discoveries, including mountains on the moon, a
vast array of stars, sun-spots, and Jupiter's moons. All of these
conflicted thoroughly with Aristotelian cosmology, and played a
pivotal role in converting the scientific community to
Copernicanism.

species to evolve into a wholly new one, Darwin argued. So
persuasive was the evidence Darwin adduced for his theory that by
the start of the 20th century it was accepted as scientific
orthodoxy, despite considerable theological opposition (Figure 3).
Subsequent work has provided striking confirmation of Darwin's
theory, which forms the centrepiece of the modern biological
world-view.

consider scientific experimentation. Suppose a scientist does an
experiment and gets a particular result. He repeats the experiment
a few times and keeps getting the same result. After that he will
probably stop, confident that were he to keep repeating the
experiment, under exactly the same conditions, he would continue
to get the same result. This assumption may seem obvious, but as
philosophers we want to question it. Why assume that future
repetitions of the experiment will yield the same result? How do we
know this is true? The scientist is unlikely to spend too much time
puzzling over these somewhat curious questions: he probably has
better things to do. They are quintessentially philosophical
questions, to which we return in the next chapter.

not. The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein argued that there is no
fixed set of features that define what it is to be a 'game'. Rather,
there is a loose cluster of features most of which are possessed by
most games. But any particular game may lack any of the features in
the cluster and still be a game. The same may be true of science. If
so, a simple criterion for demarcating science from pseudo-science
is unlikely to be found.
