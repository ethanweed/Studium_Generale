> Psammetichus’ explicit purpose — that is, the role that he
> designed the inquiry to play — was ethnographic, rather than
> linguistic, in the sense that he wanted to determine which was
> the oldest human group.

> However, the contributions of the story to ethnography have
> since come to be dwarfed by its contributions to discussion of
> language.

> There are a number of reasons why the ethnographic reading of
> the story might not have thrived. In the modern world, of
> course, there is little reason to believe that Psammetichus was
> right that Phrygians were the world’s first people, and less
> reason to trust his means of arriving at that conclusion.

> Even in Psammetichus’ own milieu it is not clear how much weight
> his conclusions carried.

> In fact, the original ethnographic motiva- tion for the inquiry
> has now passed so far from view that it is rarely acknowledged.

> Instead, the story is virtually always represented as an attempt
> to understand lin- guistic matters, confidently introduced in
> modern literature as “an experiment in order to find out which
> human language was the first” (Berko Gleason & Ratner 1998: 377)

> What all these texts have in common is that they extract from
> the story specific information that contributes to historical
> understanding. In addition, Psammeti- chus’ inquiry has also
> served a broader historical purpose, namely, as evidence for
> earlier cultures’ general curiosity about language.

> This is a common motiva- tion for referring in passing to the
> story, especially in works that survey linguistics for novice
> students.

> Thus the very different introductory textbooks on linguistics
> written by Bloomfield (1933: 4–5) and by Hudson (2000: 490–491)
> both recount the story to illustrate that people in the ancient
> world reflected on language.

> Both writers advert to Herodotus’ story as representing the
> linguistic preoccupations of the Greeks, then move directly to
> Plato, and quickly on to Thrax — making it clear that the goal
> is to give a reader glimpses from a panorama of ancient writ-
> ings on language, minimally interpreted.

> However, all of these scholars share the same overarching
> purpose in retelling the story, in that they treat it as an
> instrument for understanding the ancient world: its value lies
> in what it reveals about the people who carried out the inquiry,
> or (more commonly) the people who recorded it.

> Lau- nay (1980: 406) located what she called four major “means
> of access” into Psam- metichus’ inquiry.

> Her thesis is that many 16th-century writers told idiosyncratic
> versions of the story, shaped to fit their own perspectives on
> the identity of the

> the story has probably most commonly been cited in the context
> of a different famous question, that of glottogenesis, or the
> origin of language.6 A typical move is to recite the story to
> substantiate a claim that the origin of language is “a puzzle
> that has always stirred men’s imaginations”

> That the story is retold, early and often, signals that it has
> infused discus- sion about the origin of language

> Each of these scholars narrates a thought experiment in which
> imaginary first speakers develop language. Rous- seau
> (1969[1781]: 516–527) created an elaborate pastoral tableau of
> two young pairs of first speakers, in the southern versus
> northern climates, each of whom in- vents language.

> But Herodotus’ text seems present right beneath the surface in
> each case, in the details of all four narratives

> Perhaps by the 18th century Psammeti- chus’ inquiry had become
> so integrated into discourse about language that no spe- cific
> invocation of it was needed for readers to hold it in mind.9

> Since the 1960s, preoccupations born of the advent of generative
> grammar have brought forward a different reading of the story,
> breathing new relevance into it.

> That reading is epistemological in the sense that it interprets
> Psammetichus to have investigated the sources of linguistic
> knowledge, in particular, the relative contributions of what is
> inborn versus what is acquired from the environment.

> Gennette (1976: 159–160, n. 2) cites a number of writers who
> have objected that Psammeti- chus ignores an obvious possible
> source of the word bekos in the children’s imitation of the
> goats.

> Therefore it may not be surprising that, in discussion of what
> children are born knowing about language versus what they learn
> from their surroundings, contemporary linguistic literature
> routinely recycles the story of Psammetichus’ inquiry past a new
> generation of readers.

> Hoff (2001: 8) in- troduces the story as “asking about the
> language [that] the brain creates when it is not given an
> existing language to learn”

> Ferguson and Slobin (1973: vii) depict it as Psammetichus’
> attempt “to solve the problem of the innate factors in language
> ac- quisition”.

> Writers also commonly link the passage from Herodotus to
> literature about children who experience linguistic isolation
> either for unknown reasons (as in the case of the 19th-century
> feral child ‘Victor’ (Itard 1962 [1894]; Lane 1976), or due to
> parental abuse (‘Genie’: Curtiss 1977, Rymer 1993), or through
> the mishap of being born deaf into a hearing fam- ily that
> failed to accommodate the child’s communicative needs (Feldman
> et al. 1978).

> Nevertheless, references to Psammetichus’ inquiry remain
> ubiquitous, especially in literature addressed to students in
> their first ex- posure to the study of language. After 2700
> years, the story has still not worn out its welcome in
> discussion of matters linguistic.

> In the study of language since the 1960s, its chief role has
> been to at- test to the existence of pre-modern
> linguistic-epistemological inquiry.

> But it also seems to serve another, implicit, purpose: in
> adverting to Psammetichus’ inquiry, modern scholars communicate
> a position they assume vis-à-vis the history of lin- guistics.

#### [Page 11](highlights://05_Thomas#page=11)

> In several ways, this passage typifies modern recitations of
> Psammetichus’ in- quiry. It appears in a textbook, a predictable
> environment for the story.

> The explicit reason for telling the story is, as usual, to
> demonstrate the longevity of human curiosity about how children
> learn language, presumably so as to heighten readers’ investment
> in the topic.

> it signals how the modern discipline orients itself toward
> earlier inquiry into language. That is to say, my sense is that
> the story serves as a tool in readers’ intellectual
> socialization, mod- eling for them a particular stance with
> respect to how people in other centuries approached linguistic
> questions.

> That sense derives from three observations about how present-day
> writers present the story.

> ‘old shepherd couple’.

> “servant”

> “mute servant”

> “herdsmen”

> “shepherds”

> “brought up by goats”.

> “in total silence”.

> “a mountain hut”

> “an isolated mountain hut”

> “secluded compound”

> “severe cultural and linguistic isolation”

> Bekos is sometimes misidenti- fied as a Phoenician word
> (Atkinson et al. 1988: 3) or, bizarrely, as Egyptian (Ellis
> 1999: 3).

> “prince”

> “king of Pittus”

> pair of monarchs

> “baby boys”

> Herodotus used no gender markers.

#### [Page 12](highlights://05_Thomas#page=12)

> “shepherd ... [was] said to have been Phrygian”

> “taking pity on the infants, he disobeyed the pharaoh’s orders”.

> “treat [the infants] well”

> not to speak to them “on pain of death”

> Many of these novelties likely derive from the fact that few
> modern writers who re-tell the story have encountered it
> directly in the Histories, either in translation or in Greek.
> Instead, they are probably recounting it from memory, second- or
> third- hand, or many times removed from Herodotus’ text, much
> less from Herodotus’ own source.

> This renders even small divergences from Herodotus’ version
> revealing because, as the story evolves away from its source,
> the new content it assumes communicates something about how
> those who retell the story construe it, and about their motives.

> Com- ing as it does out of a social and intellectual culture
> vastly different from that of modern Euro-American linguistic
> scholarship, the narrative likely strikes readers as alien. It
> is not surprising, then, that writers add particulars or even
> substan- tive novelty to make it more vivid or engaging to the
> modern imagination.

> In these ways the story of Psammatichus’ inquiry is remodeled,
> if sometimes only subtly, to meet the anticipated needs of
> contemporary readers.

> The problem is that to domesticate the past on the model of the
> present deceives read- ers into assuming more continuity than
> may actually exist, leaving them under- prepared to appreciate
> whatever differences of attitude and experience separate the
> intellectual world of Herodotus, or of ancient Egypt, from that
> of the 21st century.

> O’Grady et al. present Psammetichus as an experimental
> psycholinguist avant la lettre, and in this way create common
> ground between his interests and perspec- tive and those of
> their readers.

> Going back at least as far as the 17th century, many writers
> have depicted Psammetichus’ inquiry as an ‘experiment’

> “the first record- ed language acquisition experiment”

> “the first recorded scientific study of language origins”

> “the first recorded psycholinguistic ex- periment”

> “ultimate language-learning experiment”

> “The intellectual honesty of Psammetichus is astonishing. He
> could become the patron of present- day experimenters”

> In a coda to the narrative, Rymer raised the pharaoh’s
> historical status beyond that of the first psycholinguist,
> identifying him as “the protolinguist, the earliest practitioner
> of an enduring scientific pursuit”.

> “[f]ascination with [language acqui- sition] dates back to at
> least the seventh century B.C.”

> “Most linguists would agree with Herodotus that lan- guages can
> arise de novo”, as if the Greek historian himself were
> responsible for the ‘experiment’.

#### [Page 14](highlights://05_Thomas#page=14)

> But in what may be an example of the language of proof,
> Herodotus has the pharaoh concede the priority of Phrygian on
> the basis of a chain of inferences fol- lowing from observation
> of a deliberately contrived event.

> the modern notion of an empirical experiment entails a complex
> of assumptions and traditions for which neither 7th-century B.C.
> Egypt nor 5th- century B.C Greece should unquestioningly be made
> responsible.

> To label Psam- metichus’ inquiry as an ‘experiment’ and to
> identify the pharaoh as a precursor to 21st-century language
> science, is to assimilate him into our world and downplay the
> distance between him and us. To do so makes the past safer and
> less threaten- ing, but only at the cost of making it less
> interesting and less worthy of meticulous and disciplined study.

> Perhaps one of the reasons why Psammetichus’ inquiry is still
> retold in modern linguistics is that it can be narrated in such
> as way as to make the past seem tractable, both by elaborating
> on the story so as to increase its appeal to modern readers, and
> by attributing to it our own habits of scientific reasoning and
> data-gathering.

#### [Page 15](highlights://05_Thomas#page=15)

> It is almost compulsory for writers who admiringly present ‘the
> first recorded psycholinguistic experiment’ to (in the same
> breath) repudiate its morality, sometimes by styling it “the
> forbidden experi- ment”, an expression popularized by Shattuck

> “[present-day] research strategies allow linguistic development
> to be in- vestigated in a more acceptable and fruitful way”

> “we would no longer conduct this experiment on purpose”;

> “the method of the experiment is certainly unethical”

> “No one today is prepared to revive the attempts attributed to
> the pharaoh”.

> “pursued his question with an unbiased rigor and a devotion to
> the scientific method which could be seen as admi- rably
> unsentimental, if not downright brutal”.

> “This is an unethi- cal experiment! The ancient Egyptians did
> many things that the National Institutes of Health would never
> allow”

> “only someone with the conscience of a Joseph Mengele would
> carry out such an experiment”.

> I believe that the critique of Psammetichus’ inquiry on ethical
> grounds actually serves the same end as his incorporation into
> modern language science.

> by labeling the story as a precocious experiment about language
> acquisition that is nonetheless fatally flawed by contemporary
> standards, one evades the challenge of trying to under- stand
> how radically different the past is from the present.

> To attribute, even play- fully, to an Egyptian pharaoh an
> imperfect grasp of the local, culture-bound, ideals we
> 21st-century language scientists hold ourselves to is a
> potentially risky act of historical self-centeredness.

#### [Page 16](highlights://05_Thomas#page=16)

> Modern scholars do not present the story point- blank as
> evidence that study of the past can be dispensed with; on the
> contrary, they often treat it as a kind of historical grace note
> that enriches their exposition.

> However, the story is told in such a way as to preempt real
> inquiry into the world of language and language attitudes that
> Psammetichus, or Herodotus, lived in.

#### [Page 17](highlights://05_Thomas#page=17)

> The belief that language was innate led to the strange
> hallucination that if a child were entirely secluded from human
> contact, he would speak instinctively the primitive language of
> mankind.

#### [Page 18](highlights://05_Thomas#page=18)

> Because the story of Psammetichus’ inquiry is prevalent in
> textbooks and other introductory materials, one might assume
> that its purpose is to introduce modern students of language to
> the history of linguistics, or at least to remind them that the
> discipline has a long history.

> However, framing this 2700-year old text in the now-conventional
> manner, which relativizes it to the world of the reader,
> paradox- ically serves to orient neophytes away from inquiry
> into the past.

> some scholars assimilate it into modern linguistic research,

> inappro- priately strange (therefore less valuable).
