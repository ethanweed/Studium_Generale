> 'clitics'

An unstressed word, typically a function word, that is incapable of standing on its own and attaches in pronunciation to a stressed word, with which it forms a single accentual unit. Examples of clitics are the pronoun ’em in I see ’em and the definite article in French l'arme, “the arm.”
A morpheme that functions like a word, but appears not as an independent word but always attached to a following or preceding word.
