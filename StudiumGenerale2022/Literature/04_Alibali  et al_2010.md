> Thus, gesture plays a role in speech production because it plays

> In brief, according to the Information Packaging Hypothesis,
> gesture plays a role in thinking.

> To accomplish this goal, we developed two tasks that elicit
> comparable utterances, but make different demands on the
> conceptual ‘‘packaging’’ of spatial information.

> If gesture serves to facilitate generation of the surface forms
> of utterances, as predicted by the Lexical Retrieval Hypothesis,
> then gesture production in the two tasks should be comparable.

> Any differences in gesture production across tasks would provide
> evidence against the Lexical Retrieval Hypothesis.

> Certain patterns of differences across tasks would provide
> speci􏰥c support for the Information Packaging Hypothesis.

> For one of the tasks, we chose a classic task from the
> developmental literature: Piagetian conservation.

> As one of the tasks in the present study, we asked children to
> explain their conservation judgements.

> In the second task, we asked children simply to describe how two
> items (e.g., a glass of sand and a bowl of sand) looked
> different.

> We expected children to focus on perceptual dimensions of the
> task objects in both tasks.

> If comparable lexical items are accessed in the two tasks, then
> under the Lexical Retrieval Hypothesis, gesture production
> should not differ across the tasks.

> we argue that there are two important differences in
> conceptualisation across the two tasks:

> (1) children’s thinking is more constrained in the explanation
> task than in the description task,

> (2) children’s thinking is more complex in the explanation task
> than in the description task.

> In the explanation task, but not the description task, children
> must decide whether the two quantities are the same or different
> amounts, and therefore they must identify the particular
> dimension(s) that are relevant to the quantity comparison. That
> is, children must zero in on the particular dimension(s) (e.g.,
> height, width, shape, etc.) that justify their judgements about
> whether the quantities are the same or different.

> In contrast, in the description task, children simply focus on
> how the two objects look different.

> How should gesture differ across tasks if conceptualisation for
> one task is more constrained than conceptualisation for the
> other?

> in the process of zeroing in on the relevant dimensions,
> children will use gesture to explore various dimensions of the
> task objects.

> Thus, the explanation task should elicit more gestures
> representing physical properties of the task objects than the
> description task.

> Note that, in both tasks, children need to refer to the task
> objects, and they almost always use deictic referring terms such
> as ‘‘this one’’ and ‘‘that one’’ to do so. Such expressions
> require a deictic (indicating) gesture in order to be
> interpreted by the listener, and in this sense, the gestures
> produced along which such deictic terms serve a communicative
> function.

> In some cases, children produce gestures that serve only to
> indicate the task objects (e.g., saying ‘‘this glass is wide’’
> while pointing to the side of the glass). In such cases,
> children’s gestures are purely deictic. In other cases, children
> produce gestures that serve both to indicate the objects, and to
> represent or highlight some physical properties of the objects
> (e.g., saying ‘‘this glass is skinny’’ while holding both hands
> at the sides of the glass to show the width of the glass).

> Thus, we expected children to produce gestures for deictic
> references in both tasks. Hence, we do not predict a difference

> Thus, children should produce more non-redundant gestures in the

> Finally, the asynchrony between the onset of a gesture and its
> lexical af􏰥liate is greater for less familiar lexical items
> (Morrel-Samuels & Krauss, 1992).

> Further, we acknowledge that the discourse demands of the two
> tasks differ, and that this may have contributed to the observed
> differences in the nature of the gestures produced across tasks.

> plays a role in conceptualising the message to be verbalised.
