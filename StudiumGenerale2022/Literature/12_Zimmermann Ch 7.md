> Sir Francis Bacon (1561–1626)

> The typical researcher of his day, Bacon lamented, ‘flies from
> the senses and particulars to the most general axioms’, which he
> does not question but takes to be settled. True science,
> however, should be based on practical experimentation and
> proceed inductively.

> Knowledge is what happens to the detached observer, whose
> personality, disposition, and imagination contribute nothing to
> scientific discoveries. This systematic elimination of the
> knower from the process of knowing with a sole focus on the
> object of knowledge is called ‘scientific objectivism’.

> French astronomer and mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749–
> 1827)

> ‘positivism’

> scientific facts would eventually reveal all general physical
> laws by which the world functioned, and thus render the world
> predictable.

> Scientific knowledge is thus modelled on a mechanic’s
> understanding of a machine: know the parts and how they function
> in relation to each other, and you know how the whole mechanism
> works.

> French philosopher and sociologist August Comte (1798–1857)

> extended Laplace’s mechanistic ideal of knowledge to our
> understanding of society as a whole

> Paul Fyerabend (1924–94),

> scientific observation is not unbiased but always ‘theory-laden’

> Thomas Kuhn (1922–96)

> Instead, striving for coherence through the integration of
> particulars into a meaningful whole, science proceeds
> hermeneutically. Every supposedly neutral observation is
> theory-laden; that is, facts are selected and recognized
> according to a certain interpretive framework.

> hermeneutic circle,

refers to the idea that one's understanding of the text as a whole is established by reference to the individual parts and one's understanding of each individual part by reference to the whole.
