> Hindu tradition.

> Greek grammatical tradition,

> A persistent controversy was whether “nature” or “convention”
> accounted for the relationship between words and their meaning,

> For the Greeks, morphology (word structure) was mostly a
> historical matter

> Syntax was not described directly, but aspects of syntax were
> treated in rhetoric and logic.

> Grammarians followed Aristotle’s view that scientific knowledge
> is universal or general and applies to all subject mat­ ter,
> including grammar, hence universal grammar.

> Bacon is famous for his state­ ment that “grammar is
> substantially one and the same in all languages, although it may
> vary accidentally” (Bursill-Hall 1995: 131).

> Francisco Sánchez (Sanctius) de las Brozas (1523–1601) in
> Minerva, seu de causis linguae latinae (1587) attempted to
> reconcile Plato and Aristotle by explaining that the
> “convention” favored by Aristotle was “reasoned,” and, since
> reasoning is universal, God-given, it comes from “nature,” which
> is what Sanctius believed Plato to have favored. Thus Sanctius’
> philosophy of language was “a rational discovery of the
> underlying ‘perfection’ or logic of language from which actual
> speech is derived”

> 4 The Rise of the Comparative Method

> Through voyages, conquests, trading, and colonialization from
> the sixteenth century onward, Europe became acquainted with a
> wide variety of languages. Information on languages from Africa,
> Asia, and America became available in the form of word lists,
> grammars, dictionaries, and religious texts, and attempts at
> classifying these languages followed.

> Historical linguistic interests had a background in the Greek
> tradition’s nature-versus-convention debate about lan­ guage
> origins and its interest in etymology, as well as in the
> biblically based notion of Hebrew as the original language
> (Lingua Adamica, Lingua Paradisiaca) from which all others were
> assumed to descend after the confounding of tongues at Babel.

> Large-scale word collections for language comparisons were a
> notable feature of the centuries after the Renaissance.

> Hoenigswald’s summary of the points upon which seventeenth- and
> eighteenth-century scholars agreed concerning criteria for
> establishing language families is telling:

> First, . . . there was “the concept of a no longer spoken parent
> language which in turn produced the major linguistic groups of
> Asia and Europe”.

> Then there was . . . “a Scaliger concept of the develop­ ment of
> languages into dialects and of dialects into new independent
> languages”.

> Third came “certain minimum standards for determining what words
> are borrowed and what words are ancestral in a language”

> fourth, “an insistence that not a few random items, but a large
> number of words from the basic vocabulary should form the basis
> of comparison”

> fifth, the doctrine that “grammar” is even more important than
> words

> sixth, the idea that for an etymology to be valid the
> differences in sound – or in “letters” – must recur, under a
> principle sometimes referred to as “analogia”.

> From the fifteenth century onward, etymology had been shifting
> away from its sense in classical antiquity of unfolding the true
> meaning of words toward a historical search for earlier stages
> in languages and the origin of words (Robins 1990: 86)

> 4.1 The Scythian hypothesis and the notion of Indo-European

> Eventually, comparative linguistics came to have Indo-European
> languages as its main concern. Early recognition of the family
> relationship among Indo-European languages is connected in­
> timately with the “Scythian hypothesis.”

> The Scythae of Classical writers (Herodotus, Strabo, Justin,
> etc.) were a nation on a sea in the north in extreme antiquity.
> Josephus and early Christian writers took them to be the
> descendants of Japheth (son of Noah), the assumed father of
> Europe (Droixhe 1984: 5), and the Scythian linguistic hypothesis
> emerged from these notions.
