> Claims and conclusions

I shall aim in this chapter to explain:

- what an argument consists of;
- what we do when we reason;
- how an argument answers a question;
- what it means to draw a conclusion.

> Perhaps when we make any claim, whether in speech or in writing,
> we want to persuade others to do or think something; but it may
> not be safe only to imply Qâ€”readers or listeners may not infer
> the Q that you had in mind.

- There is more religion in newspapers than in churches and

> Titles as questions

> Our original four titles could easily enough be reworded as
> questions:

- To what extent can Iceland be called a European country? a
- In what sense did John Steinbeck write from a decided political
position?
- Why did the takeover of Cadbury by Kraft Foods prove to be
controversial?
- How important for language acquisition is attachment to a primary
carer?

> I have considered three sorts of title: the noun-phrase, the
> claim, and the question.

> Support for a conclusion

- What was Cadbury like before the takeover?
- How did Cadbury respond to Kraft's proposals?
- How far did this response affect the outcome?
