> Bell deduced, any theory that reproduced the same em- pirical

> “mechanism whereby the setting of one measuring de- vice can
> influence the reading of another instrument, however remote.”

> Such long-distance correlations be- came known as “quantum
> entanglement.”

> Herbert’s scheme looked watertight. Several reviewers at the
> journal where he submitted his idea were convinced by his argu-
> ment. “We have not been able to identify any fundamental flaws
> with the proposed experiment that reveal the origin of the para-
> dox,” reported two referees. Another referee, Asher Peres, took
> an even bolder step. He proclaimed in his brief report that
> Herbert’s paper must be wrong—and hence it needed to be
> published. Be- cause Peres himself could find no flaw, he argued
> that the error must be meaty, the kind that would prompt further
> advances.

> In 1984 Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard built di- rectly on
> the no-cloning theorem to design the very first protocol for
> “quantum encryption”: a brand-new way to protect digital sig-
> nals from potential eavesdroppers. As Bennett and Brassard real-
> ized, the fact that quantum mechanics forbids anyone from mak-
> ing copies of an unknown quantum state meant that partners

> could encode secret messages in entangled photons and pass them
> back and forth. If anyone tried to intercept a photon en route
> and make copies, they would immediately destroy the sought-after
> signal and announce their presence at the same time.
