> One possibility is that language affects perception directly;

> Our results do not discriminate among these possibilities.

> First, each participant’s blue–green lexical boundary was

> Only the 11 participants who placed the blue–green boundary
> between stimuli B and C were included in analysis of the visual
> search data.
