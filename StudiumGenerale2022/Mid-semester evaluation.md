Studium Generale mid-semester evaluation

**Mainly positive comments**:
- good amount of teaching for the reading can follow along without reading everything
- Thursday presentations good / discussions
- review
- classical articles: good to read the originals and not just read about them in textbooks
- good with no textbooks
- good with articles arranged in a structure on brightspace

**Negative**:
- only one hour on Thursdays with no other classes. A lot of travel time for only one class
- worry about exam: looked at questions from last year, and not sure they could answer them in 4 days
	- possible solution: look at some old exam questions together in class
