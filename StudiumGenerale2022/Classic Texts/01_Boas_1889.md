From Wikipedia:

In his dissertation research, Boas' methodology included investigating how different intensities of light created different colors when interacting with different types of water;[54] however, he encountered difficulty in being able to objectively perceive slight differences in the color of water, and as a result became intrigued by this problem of perception and its influence on quantitative measurements.[54][60] Boas, due to tone deafness, would later encounter difficulties also in studying tonal languages such as Laguna.[61] Boas had already been interested in Kantian philosophy since taking a course on aesthetics with Kuno Fischer at Heidelberg. These factors led Boas to consider pursuing research in psychophysics, which explores the relationship between the psychological and the physical, after completing his doctorate, but he had no training in psychology.[62][63] Boas did publish six articles on psychophysics during his year of military service (1882–1883), but ultimately he decided to focus on geography, primarily so he could receive sponsorship for his planned Baffin Island expedition.[64]

Symptoms of _receptive amusia_, sometimes referred to as "musical deafness" or "tone deafness",[7] include the inability to recognize familiar melodies, the loss of ability to read musical notation, and the inability to detect wrong or out-of tune notes.

Boas himself suffered from amusia!

Categorical perception!

“This phenomenon must be clearly distinguished from
the differential threshold of two sensations that adjoin one another in space or time.”

“In other words, the longer the interval the more readily one stimulus is mistaken for another similar one, or the longer the interval the greater the probability that a stimulus considerably differing from the original one is mistaken for the same.”

“This phenomenon may be expressed psychologically: a new sensation is apperceived
by means of similar sensations that form part of our knowledge.”

I love this ability to jump from one domain to another. This cross-disciplinarity is perhaps more difficult today than it was in the 19th century. In these first few pages, Boas moves fluidly between the fields of what we today might call “clinical linguistics”, “acoustic phonetics”, “phonology”, “psycholinguistics”, and “field linguistics”

Try pronouncing “Kaímut” and then “Kaímun” and see where your tongue ends up for each word. What is the same? What is different?

/t/ is an alveolar plosive, and /n/ is an alveolar nasal.

Boas is alluding to the idea that researchers may think that speakers of the language they are studying switch between different pronounciations, perhaps because of dialect or idiolect when in fact, he argues, it is the researchers themselves who alternate in their perception of the sounds.

> ''alternating appercep- tion."

Boas is here establishing the idea of _cultural relativism_: when attempting to understand another culture, we cannot necessarily rely on categories from our own culture.

For Boas (and later his students), anthropology consists of agents studying other agents, unlike physical sciences in which agents study objects or natural phenomena.
