For each presentation, please remember:

-   Approximately 20 minutes presentation
-   Give an introduction to the author – brief biography, and the person’s significance to linguistics
-   Say why the work in question is considered to be a classic
-   Where relevant, say something about the context of the piece
-   Raise some issues for discussion in the class

Possible issues to consider – use this as a guide: it is best if you think about the article for yourself, and what it tells you (not me!). Remember that you should read everything critically and with an eye to evaluation, including commenting on how sound and convincing you find the argument. (On the other hand, the difficulty or otherwise of the paper is of no concern here.)

1.   What is Boas’ main point in this article? What is his major conclusion?
2.   How does Boas’ point relate to modern phonology as you know it from the Understanding Linguistics course. Do his conclusions agree with the ideas of modern phonology?
3.   Specifically, comment on 1 and 2 in relation to the question as to how the last two paragraphs of the article fit with the remainder of the paper?
4.   Describe the experiments Boas refers to in the beginning of the article, commenting on what their motivations are and what their findings are. How does Boas interpret them?
5.   Do the same as 4 for Boas’ own experiments.
6.   What does Boas say about the transcription of words in languages by linguists who are doing fieldwork on them? What is the point of his discussion? How is this relevant to his main points?
7.   Boas’ discussion relates to the sound shape of languages. However it concerns a wider issue. What is that wider issue – what is the more general issue that his discussion relates to? Comment on the wider issue and experiments that have been done to investigate in this domain, commenting on the present experimental methods and those discussed by Boas.
