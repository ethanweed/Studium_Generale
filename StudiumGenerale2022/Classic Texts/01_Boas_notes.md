1.   What is Boas’ main point in this article? What is his major conclusion?

The main point in the article is that 

2.   How does Boas’ point relate to modern phonology as you know it from the UL course. Do his conclusions agree with the ideas of modern phonology?
3.   Specifically, comment on 1 and 2 in relation to the question as to how the last two paragraphs of the article fit with the remainder of the paper?
4.   Describe the experiments Boas refers to in the beginning of the article, commenting on what their motivations are and what their findings are. How does Boas interpret them?
5.   Do the same as 4 for Boas’ own experiments.
6.   What does Boas say about the transcription of words in languages by linguists who are doing fieldwork on them? What is the point of his discussion? How is this relevant to his main points?
7.   Boas’ discussion relates to the sound shape of languages. However it concerns a wider issue. What is that wider issue – what is the more general issue that his discussion relates to? Comment on the wider issue and experiments that have been done to investigate in this domain, commenting on the present experimental methods and those discussed by Boas.



Linguists at the time (particularly **Daniel Garrison Brinton**, to whom the article was responding) argued that Native American languages had certain sounds that regularly alternated and that these alternating sounds were not a function of individual accents or mispronunciations. Drawing on the **prevailing social evolutionary theories of the time**, Brinton suggested that the extensive **inconsistency of sounds** within these languages signaled **linguistic inferiority** and thus evidenced Native Americans’ lower position on the social evolution ladder.


Boas also found that **Native American speakers also misheard the sounds produced by the linguists’ native languages**, demonstrating that the **apperception went both ways**. These findings about sound perception are analogous to the way language affects color perception. It’s not that language makes people color-blind or “sound-blind” (i.e., physically incapable of perceiving colors or sounds), it just instills an apperception that makes it difficult to perceive colors/sounds in the same way as people from other cultures with radically different languages.

This article had a major impact on linguistics, causing a fundamental shift in how linguists study new languages and bringing about the differentiation between **phonemics (or phonology) and phonetics.**

There is no bit of linguistic ideology more pervasive or more
emblematic of contact between Spanish and Quechua. Newspapers
and other mass media publish discussions of _motosidad_ and its
implications orthographic and educational; street comedians and
editorial cartoonists satirize it; a long-running popular comic strip,
Supercholo, has had its hero mix up the vowels of Spanish. Conversely,
discussions of norms for writing Quechua have become inflamed over
whether to use the Quechua or the Spanish vowels, to the point of
death threats. Like the **late nineteenth-century popular ideas that
Native North Americans were "sound blind," physiologically unable
to perceive certain linguistic sounds, because they spoke English with
distinctive accents mediated by their first languages,** a fable that was
falsified at the end of the nineteenth century by the anthropologist
Franz Boas (1889), motosidad has become mainstay of the popular a
and scholarly landscape, an ideological fact on the ground, always
described at the interface between Spanish and Quechua.


A growing body of empirical phonetic evidence suggests that the
interface between Spanish and Quechua looks a great deal like that
discussed by Boas in the nineteenth century. Just as "sound
blindness" was a misrecognition by English speakers of the normal
effects of first-language sound patterns on the production of a second
language, so too is _motosidad_ an artifact of Spanish speakers'
misrecognition of Quechua sound patterns in the speech of second
language Spanish speakers. Along with the misrecognition of the
source of so-called motosidad, there is also a misattribution. Focusing
on the interface between Spanish and a Quechua that is represented
as sociolinguistically flat, motosidad, both as linguistic ideology and as
the object of attention by linguists, **erases the internal register
differentiation in Quechua**, a differentiation sensitive to linguistic
biography and to social class.
