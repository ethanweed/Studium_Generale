The scope of linguistics should be:
a) to describe and trace the history of all observable languages,
which amounts to tracing the history of families of languages and
reconstructing as far as possible the mother language of each
family;
b) to determine the forces that are permanently and universally
at work in all languages, and to deduce the general laws to which
all specific historical phenomena can be reduced; and
c) to delimit and define itself.

Everything in
language is basically psychological, including its material and
mechanical manifestations, such as sound changes;

That linguistics should continue to be the prerogative of a few
specialists would be unthinkable-everyone is concerned with it in
one way or another.

Other sciences work with objects that are given in advance and
that can then be considered from different viewpoints; but not
linguistics. Someone pronounces the French word nu 'bare': a
superficial observer would be tempted to call the word a concrete
linguistic object; but a more careful examination would reveal
successively three or four quite different things, depending on
whether the word is considered as a sound, as the expression of an
idea, as the equivalent of Latin nudum, etc. Far from it being the
object that antedates the viewpoint, it would seem that it is the
viewpoint that creates the object; besides, nothing tells us in
advance that one way of considering the fact in question takes
precedence over the others or is in any way superior to them.
