#What is science? - From Bird (1998), Introduction
## Science vs. pseudo-science

    - Criteria from last time
### “Creation science”

    - Literal reading of the book of Genesis
        - God created the universe.
        - Creationism is a scientific theory
        - There is scientific evidence for this
    - Science and religion have not always been separate (e.g.
      Descartes)
    - Political reason for promoting the idea of Creation Science:
        - Religious doctrine cannot be taught in American state schools
        - But scientific theory can
    - Arkansas passed a law requiring equal treatment of evolution and
      creationism in state schools
        - Scientists and religious leaders objected
            - Question was *not*
                - whether creationism is true
                - whether creationism is possible
            - Question was:
                - is creation science *scientific*?
                    - Side note: change in societal norms
                        - Previously, it was illegal to teach evolution
                        - Now, it is illegal to teach unscientific
                          theories
        - Judge (William R. Overton) decided the case on the following
          criteria: a scientific theory is:
            - guided by natural law (law of nature)
            - is explanatory by reference to natural law
            - testable against the empirical world
            - conclusions are tentative (subject to change)
            - is falsifiable
### Laws of nature

    - Different from *statements* of laws of nature
        - There may be statements of laws of nature which are untrue
            - Phlogistion Becher 1667
        - There may exist laws of nature which have never been stated
          (or discovered)
    - Laws of nature tend to entail regularities (all Fs are Gs)
        - But some regularities are not laws
            - a) All persisting lumps of pure gold-195 have a mass of
              less than 1000 kg
            - b) All persisting lumps of pure uranium-235 have a mass
              of less that 1000 kg
        - a) is true, but only because there don’t happen to be any
          lumps with a mass over 1000 kg. But it would be possible. It
          is not a law
        - b) is true, but this is because the uranium isotope’s
          instability makes it *impossible* for there to ever be a lump
          with a mass over 1000 kg.
    - Counterfactuals
        - Law: Black things absorb heat more quickly than white things
            - Freddies car is black, and when he left it in the sun it
              got hot very quickly
            - “If his car had been white, it would have gotten hot less
              quickly”
            - Laws support counterfactuals
    - Much more to say about laws of nature, but this goes beyond this
      course. See e.g. Bird (1998) Chapter 1.
###Inference

    - Deductive argument
        - “All mammals suckle their young/otter are mammals/therefore
          otters suckle their young”
        - “Duck-billed platypuses do not suckle their young/platypuses
          are mammals/therefore not all mammals suckle their young
        - Scientific inference is typically *not* inductive. Why?
    - Inductive argument
        - Non-deductive (empirical sciences vs. pure math / logic)
        - Argue from specific cases to support a generalization
            - Problem with induction - David Hume (1711-1776)
                - We use induction to justify our belief in a
                  conclusion. Examples?
                - Where does the justification come from?
                    - Can’t be deduction. Why not?
                    - We could argue that induction usually works
                      (although we use induction all the time in our
                      daily life)
                        - This just uses induction to justify
                          induction, which is circular
                    - We could try to turn induction into deduction by
                      adding a clause: “unobserved cases resemble
                      observed cases”
                        - But how can we be sure this is true?
                    - We could use probabilistic reasoning (statistics)
                        - But this is just another form of induction
