# Studium Generale final exam

NB: this is the exam for students who are *not* doing the Portfolio exam

Please choose 4 of the 5 questions below to answer. You may assign number of pages as you see fit, but please devote at least 1 page to each of the four questions you answer. The total number of pages should be around 10 “normal” pages.

## Question 1
Chomsky observed a phenomenon in nature, that is, the rapid acquisition of grammar by children. He proposed an explanation for this, namely that children are able to acquire grammar quickly and seemingly effortlessly because they are born already in possession of the core syntactic rules, the "Universal Grammar". Based on what you have read in Bird (1998), Campbell (2001), and what we have discussed in class:

- place Chomsky’s nativist theory of generative linguistics within the larger context of the history of linguistics
- debate whether or not Chomsky’s “cognitive revolution” can be seen as a “scientific revolution” in the Kuhnian sense.

## Question 2
Describe your group’s approach to the box project. Place your group’s experience with the box project within the theoretical texts we have read over the semester: philosophy of science Kuhn, Popper, Bird, Latour, etc. What was the point of the box project, and did it change the way you think about scientific investigation?

## Question 3
Pick a recent scientific article from any subfield of linguistics that you are interested in. Read the article and write a critique of the research presented in the article. Integrate the concepts of falsification, inductive reasoning, and “inscription” (in Latour’s sense) in your critique of the article. You do not have to disagree with the conclusions presented by the author(s), but place the article’s research and conclusions in the broader perspective of the history of linguistics, current trends in linguistic research, and insights from the philosophy of science.

## Question 4
You have decided to apply for funding for a three-year PhD project at Aarhus University. You are free to design the project any way you like, but there are some restrictions. The project must be on one of the following topics:

- linguistic relativity
- linguistic creolization
- language acquisition
- linguistics of interactions


Write a draft of your application, including:

- your specific research question
- the methods you will use to research your topic
- a realistic time-line for your project
- your plans for disseminating the results of your research
- any unusual costs or expenses associated with the project

Your application draft should be written as realistically as possible. That is, write a project proposal that you feel would have the best possible chances of being funded were it a real proposal, and do not propose experiments or other research that would be ethically, financially, or logistically impossible. Treat it as much as possible as if it were a real application, and the progress of your scientific career depended on your project being funded.

## Question 5
Pick a recent scientific article from any subfield of linguistics that you are interested in. Read the article and write a critique of the research presented in the article. Integrate the concepts of falsification, inductive reasoning, and “inscription” (in Latour’s sense) in your critique of the article. You do not have to disagree with the conclusions presented by the author(s), but place the article’s research and conclusions in the broader perspective of the history of linguistics, current trends in linguistic research, and insights from the philosophy of science.
