# Questions for Bird Chapter 2 part 2

1. For Bird, “Humean induction” refers to more specific kind of
  scientific argument, i.e. one where we argue from several particular
  cases to the truth of a generalization covering them [e.g.] the case
  of a doctor who took the existence of many anaemic colitis sufferers
  to be evidence for the claim that all colitis sufferers have anaemia.
  On page 57 he describes “inference to the best explanation” and on
  page 58 says that this is different than Humean induction. Describe
  in your own words, what the difference is that Bird sees between
  these two types of induction.
2. What does “desiderata” mean?
3. What does Bird mean by explanations being “elliptical”?
4. Bird suggests that quantitative explanations are better than
  qualitative explanations. Why does he say this, what exactly does he
  mean, and do you agree? Why or why not?
5. Bird suggests that Hume’s problem of induction applies to favoring
  simple, strong explanations over other explanations. What does he
  mean by this?
6. In your own words, describe:
    1. The hypothetical-deductive model
    2. The paradox of confirmation
7. In your own words, describe what Bird means by a “holistic” approach
  to explanation.
8. Search through the articles you have read for a class, or for an
  exam. In your own words, describe:
    1. The phenomenon being dealt with in the article
    2. The proposed explanation
    3. The type of evidence used to support the explanation
    4. The explanatory mechanism
